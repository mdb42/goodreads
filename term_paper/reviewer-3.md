Reviewer #3 isn’t just a data point — they’re an **essayist in disguise**, and trying to compress them would risk flattening their intent. They deserve a slow read, not a scatterplot.

--- 1. Divergent (Divergent, #1) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2016-05-27

(Review also on amazon) This book is one of those complex things where you like it and you don't like it. There are aspects of this book that I really enjoyed and because of that, I would recommend the book. However, there are things in this book that I hate and don't want anyone to read it. -Things are inconsistent. First Tris mentions how on Visiting Day, parents will come to the children, then how the children go back to the families, then how the parents go to them. So... I'm not sure which way it is. Also a question about the ages between Tris and her brother, Caleb. Veronica mentions that Tris is a "few months" into being sixteen and Caleb and Tris are "less than a year" apart in age. Since they can't be less than nine months in age and even then that's very rare and impossible, there has to be at least nine months between them. Few months mean more than two. I'm thinking about four or five. Let's go with four here. Four months plus nine months is one year and one month. So Caleb would be seventeen. Even if it was three months as "few months", he would still be seventeen. While that's not a problem, Veronica mentions that at sixteen teens decide which fraction they'll live at. No one is younger than sixteen and no one is older than sixteen. It's once a year that it happens. So, by that logic, Caleb would have already chosen his fraction and wouldn't be able to choose this year as his year was last year. Yet, Caleb is with Tris with the Choosing Ceremony and in the same grade. So, I'm curious to find out exactly how old Caleb is and what Veronica's math is in that regard. -The world building, well, sucked. Only thing I know about Chicago is the Sears Tower and what I've seen on tv and movies. But it's not just that that Veronica fails on. I don't know what exactly this new Chicago looks like. And what about the rest of the world? Are they dead? Are they alive? Are they doing the same thing that this Chicago is doing? Are they normal? Is Chicago the new government and everyone else is trying to kill them or something and they have to protect themselves? Or is it where people might try to escape this Chicago and they have to prevent that? I don't know! I don't know anything about this new world. -It's a dystopia, but it's not very strong of a dystopia. A dystopia, by definition, is a society in a controlled state disguised as a utopia. I'm not saying that there wasn't any dystopia in here, because there was some, but it wasn't strong and in my opinion, it wasn't there until the very end. It felt like Veronica forgot that she wanted to have the dystopian aspect of it and added it at the very end to say that it was a dystopian novel. When you look at other dystopian novels, it's pretty clear to see that they are dystopian novels. Not so much in this one. Hunger Games, Uglies, Matched, Delirium, etc, they all have it clear that it's a dystopian novel. This one takes a long time to get to it and it's not very strong. -How is jumping out of trains moving fast brave? How is a tattoo brave? Those just seem stupid and pointless. Okay, you proved you can jump off a moving train onto a building. That doesn't mean you're brave. It means you're stupid and reckless with your life, willing to gamble it away. It turns out that it used to be brave to stand up for others, but now it's not. It's about doing stupid, reckless things. It took Tris the entire book to realize this and it seems pointless to have her discover it then. -There is so much detail and explanation on the first trial, the physical one, but hardly anything on the other two when they focus more on the mental aspect. The fact that you are stronger than you think. The fact that you can overcome something. But Veronica thinks it's so important to show how the physical aspect of beating someone up is more important and braver than actually overcoming a fear you have. The other two are just skimmed over. -The end is too rushed. So very rushed. I think most of the beginning/middle could have been taken out so that the end wasn't rushed. But as it was, it was very rushed and I don't think it was as good as it could have been. -Tris finally gets that she's not part of any fraction and then she's so shocked to discover this. It's not like someone tells her something she doesn't know and she's surprised. It's the fact that she knows, she admits and says that that's what she is and is okay with it. Then, she turns around and is so shocked at that when a couple pages before, she was perfectly fine with it! -How come there aren't more Divergent out there? Why do they all come from Abnegation? Why are they so rare? Why does the serum not work on them? What makes them so special that nothing works on them? Is it so strange that a person actually thinks and therefore, serums don't work on them? -How is it possible that Tris, who sucks so bad, can climb up so far? Oh right, she displays her Mary Sue traits and is able to climb up and be the best. I'm not saying she's a Mary Sue because I don't think she is, but she is displaying some very strong Mary Sue traits and she's becoming borderline. -This falls in with the inconsistent a bit, but the healing and injuries need more work. A week after getting beaten up does NOT equal bulk of muscles. A week of anything do NOT equal bulk of muscles. A gunshot to your shoulder is not going to allow you to run around and do normal things as if you aren't suffering, only to realize when someone wants to take the bullet out that it hurts. A bullet in you will hurt. It will constantly hurt. Recovery from injuries and tattoos are not instant. -Having Tris as the MC seemed pointless. Tris doesn't carry the story. The story happens around Tris and Tris just happens to be caught in it. In Hunger Games, Katniss WAS the reason for the story. Take Katniss out and you won't have a story. Take Tris out and you'll still have a story. -The love interest is so predicable and so cliched. Sometimes I feel like the only reason for him being there is to be the love interest for Tris. With all of that, which is a lot, you'd think I wouldn't like this book at all or wouldn't give it a good review. Yet, I'm giving it three stars, so clearly I enjoyed it. -It's NOT a love triangle! That alone gets it a star more than it would have. I know, it sounds stupid, but you honestly don't know how many times I have read a book where they HAVE to have a triangle. Most of the times, you don't need one. Twilight, Hunger Games, Uglies, Matched, Delirium, Wings, and the list goes on - they all have love triangles as if they needed them. (However, I will say this: if the next book in the series has any hint of a love triangle, I'm not reading any more.) -The way it's written grabs you and keeps you interested. It's not in that page turner sort of way. Or even in that way that Hunger Games grabbed you. It's in its own way. It's a huge book, yet I had no problem reading it in a short amount of time. It's where you feel compelled to read on and find out what's going to happen. -While Tris is annoying and has some Mary Sue tendencies and can be childish, she does have some redeeming qualities about her. She does struggle.. -The love story wasn't the strong part of the story. It was as a sub plot and it showed it was a sub plot. I'm so thankful it wasn't all "let's focus on how much we love each other instead of explaining the plot!" -This story has some morals about it. Random, I know, but I like that. This story focuses on choices and beliefs. Each fraction has their own beliefs and they stick to them. These beliefs make them a better, stronger person. Not only that, but there are good and bad in each fraction. It's not where every person in one fraction is all good or is all bad. There are some good and some bad mixed in. As in, there are flaws with everyone and with every fraction. -While the ending is a bit rushed, it is intense and worth it. In a way, it reminds me of the end of Mockingjay instead of Hunger Games. (Personally, I think this is a mix of Hunger Games and Mockingjay, so it would be interesting to see how Veronica will continue this as a trilogy because I don't see how it could be a trilogy.) Overall, it's not bad, but it's not entirely wonderful either. If you like dystopians, then read this book. If you want to compare it to Hunger Games, don't read it because it's not Hunger Games and there's a strong difference between the two. If you don't mind the occasional discrepancy or inconstant parts, then read it. I think it is good and it is enjoyable. If I found it at a good, cheap price, I might buy it. At least, I would read the next book in the series.

Rated 1/5 on 2015-09-23

I stopped reading about halfway. I shouldn't have started reading once I saw it was part of a series. Seeing that "book 1" in the beginning was a sign. Seriously, what could this book possibly have that it has to have more than one book? There is no need for a series. Can everyone please stop writing series? Just stop. This book is supposed to be about three girls living in NYC during the summer before they start college. Sadie from New York, Darcy from SoCal, and Rosanna from Chicago. I was hoping for different views and different personalities, but it wasn't that different. I had to keep looking at the chapter title to figure out which POV it was. Sadie was annoying perky believing in true love! Rosanna was poor, but that's okay because she's here to do good in the world and that's more important! Darcy was spoiled, rich girl from CA so therefore she's so awesome! The characters did not act like eighteen year olds. They acted more like thirteen year olds who are OMG about seeing some random person. And everyone is into instalove. I wish it wasn't instalove, but it is. And all the guys are flat, boring characters-just like the girls! Replace any of them with each other and it wouldn't make a difference. The sentences are horrible as well. It's short, choppy sentences. It's all, she this, she did that, he did this, I this, I that. It doesn't flow. I even looked at the endings as well. It doesn't get much better. All the drama at the end because they gotta leave it on a cliffhanger so you're gonna want to read on! Um, no. Just skip this book because it's not good. At all.

  

--- 3. Never Always Sometimes (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-09-23

This is a story about two best friends Dave and Julia who are in love with each other but don't say anything. It's their senior year in high school and they decided to do everything on a list they swore they'd never do in high school-including going to parties, drinking, having own BEER party, etc. It's cliched. It's best friends who love each other who end up together. Problem is, about that same time, Dave starts dating Gretchen, who is pretty much only there to put a love triangle in there. She's not needed at all. Once they start dating, that's really when Julia and Dave want to be together and of course it makes things complicated. Blah, blah, random stuff happens, then Gretchen and Dave are broken up, Julia and Dave are dating but then it gets boring for them because all they do is cuddle and sex. Then Dave starts dating Gretchen again. I spoiled it, but it's okay. It's very boring and very cliched. I probably would have not finished it had it not been for the fact that I had nothing else to read with me... It's forgettable and not interesting. Characters are dull and don't make sense. It's just all over the place and blah.

Rated 3/5 on 2015-09-16

This is one of those books that you have no idea what's going on or where the author got the idea but it's interesting and you're still reading it because it's interesting and different. (Thus the what the what tag) It was random, it was bizarre, but I enjoyed it as well and I think I look forward to more, if there's more.

  

--- 5. I Was Here (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-09-16

Cody and Meg were best friends until Meg up and killed herself and Cody realizes she doesn't know Meg as much as she thought. I forgot about this book. I wanted to completely forget about this book. It was boring. It was dull. I couldn't stand the characters. I ended up skimming a lot of it because it wasn't interesting. I just wanted to find out the ending and it wasn't worth finding out anyways.

  

--- 6. Princess of Thorns (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-09-16

It's a hot mess of every fairy tale possible thrown together and blended together with a wannabe strong, independent female who isn't who she claims. It was random. It was over the place. It was strange. It didn't make much sense. The characters were back and forth. But it's one of those, eh I'll read it anyways because there's nothing else to read.

  

--- 7. White Oleander (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-09-16

There are some things that I didn't mind in this book, but it's just dragging on and on. It seems blah and boring. It's forgettable and the characters seem either flat or over exaggerated of themselves. It doesn't flow, it's not consistent, it's like a strange dream, turned nightmare, turned who knows what else. A lot of it is unrealistic and just cringe worthy. I even decided to see if the movie was any better. It wasn't. It just confused me more and put me to sleep.

  

--- 8. Every Last Word (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-09-16

Sam is a little OCD (maybe more a lot OCD) and trying to hide that from her friends. She ends up meeting Caroline who introduces her to Poet's Corner at school and Sam starts to feel more like herself. I like that the MC was a little crazy. I don't think I've read enough books like that and I like each one I read. It's different and refreshing. The more you get to know Sam, the more you see how much her OCD bothers her. Or is taking over her life, though she acts pretty good about it not. Though I feel like it's a bit missing on some things. Not too much, but feel like sometimes the OCD could have been out more. The romance is build up and not all of a sudden. It's not surprising, but I kinda wished they did it a bit different. He hates her because she was mean to him as a child and after a good apology, he's pretty much got the hots for her? It seems rushed and too soon on that. Yet, there are other times where the pacing is slow as well. There is a twist at the end, which I actually didn't expect. I'm surprised I didn't because I can usually tell how things are going, but I think this just threw me. But as I look back, it makes sense. If you're paying attention, it might hit you what's going on. Or might not... There were a couple issues I had to question how things went, but that might have been me. Overall, I think about a 3.5 star rating.

  

--- 9. Mechanica (Mechanica, #1) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-09-15

It's the retelling of Cinderella, only a bit more steampunk, almost. There are a few retellings of Cinderella out there and it's hard to find something different. I've noticed many people compare this to Cinder but that's because it's a twist on Cinderella. Difference between them is that Cinder is a cyborg and more sci-fi, while this is more steampunk/Fey vibe going with it. That and I couldn't stand Cinder as much as everyone else did. It's very different than your usual Cinderella. Nick wants to work hard and get out of the house she's living in. She wants to find her own way out and not rely on other people. Which is a step above the old fashioned Cinderella. The problem is that most of the story is about her doing her work. Mechanic business, building machines, and so on fill the story. It's a bit boring if you're not into that. It was okay for me, but I think I might have skimmed some of it. I think it dragged on some though. It seemed like it was building up for something, maybe with the Steps, but it never happens. I'm expecting them to do more than what they do, but it's like they're more mentioned instead of in the story. I did like the fact that she starts imagining how the Prince is after she meets him. What he was like, what they might be like together, etc. Let's face it, every girl imagines everything she did when they have a crush. Then she realizes some things are just what she imagined. Not real life. And yes, it's obvious who the Prince is because it's obvious. Red flag right there. If you read the summary, you'll notice it mentions about her not sure if she wants to be with the guy. Which means that she'll decline him at the end. Maybe because she doesn't need him, maybe to be different. Who knows, but it's not surprising when it happens. (No, not spoiler as it mentions it in the summary. I hate when they do that though. Please don't spoil in the summary.) I like the fact that she's like, I thought I loved you, but it's more the thought of you. I'm not in love with you. I like how she knows the difference and that she realizes that her idea of him is not how he is entirely in real life. I liked the different twist with it, I like that it's more than just romance here. Wish it was a bit more interesting at some parts. I also wish they answered questions that they hint at but never answer. It sounds like it's leading to something, like another book, which I'm not going to like. Just answer it all in one book please.

  

--- 10. Illusionarium (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-09-10

I have no idea what's going on here. Not a clue. I started this book because it sounded interesting and it had a steampunk vibe to it and a male POV. All sounded good. Plus, that cover. I'm in love with that dress. I need to stop picking books just on covers, but what can you do? The book jumps around too much that I'm not sure how we get from one place to another. It's like there's point A then we're at point C with no explanation as to how we got there or what's going on. Then there's an illness that's only hitting the women in this world. So an airship takes the Queen, who is sick, to the MC and his father, in hopes of finding a cure in a couple of days. Keeping that in mind, everyone on the ship leaves the windows open so the Queen can get some air-even though it's bitter cold there. Windows are open so air can go in and out of the room. In the airship that belongs to the King, where people would be noisy and want to see what's going on. Think it's not possible? Jonathan's sister does just that. Gets close enough to the window so she can see the pearls. Thus also getting the air and getting infected. And then it just seems so smart to let her mother see her, be near other women, and even have female nurses help her. Guess what happens? Every female in the town gets sick. Am I surprised? Absolutely not. Then, it gets to the point where they create illusions and the illusions become real where they can enter another world. Since when did illusions, which by definition is a misleading impression of reality (keep that in mind), become real enough you could create a door and exit through it. Illusions are not real. You can make it seem real, but you can't actually do anything because it doesn't exist in real life. Suddenly, in this book, illusions are that real that you can do whatever you want. This book was so stupid, so full of holes, so annoying and frustrating that I couldn't go on. I read about a third of it and couldn't do more. It's not worth it.

  

--- 11. Defiance (Defiance #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-09-10

Not sure the reason I picked this up, maybe because I had seen it so many times, but thought I'd give it a shot. It was interesting enough that I read it quickly, which I liked. But it wasn't that good of a book either. There was no world building whatsoever. I have no idea where they are, what time period it's supposed to be similar to or what this place looks like. A map seriously would have helped. Building the world would have helped. This whole book, is it a fantasy world? A dystopian? A random place? I don't know. It had a lot of old world views on things. And the way they treated the women... That annoyed me. Women have to have someone with them at all times when they leave. Backwards thinking. Even Logan, who was not a good love interest, was violent. He grabbed Rachel often and was ready to kill her or beat her up if he wasn't lusting after her. The emotions in this book flip flop too often as well. It's love/lust, then hatred and whatever else in between. Rachel and Logan are bi-polar, flat characters. The only depth they have is the bi-polar aspect of their emotions. Rachel tries to be a strong person, but she's not. She's eh at best. It's more she tells others she is, but she doesn't show it that much. The bad guy is over the top crazy and really the characters are just not good characters. And when characters die, they don't say they're dead. Instead it's just "gone". Can they say they dead? They die? Something? Besides the gone thing because that gets old after reading it and it doesn't show much emotion behind it. It just ends, but leaves it hoping that you'll read more because it's so exciting! No, it's not. Skip it. I'm sure evil guy dead or will be dead. This book is lacking a lot of things.

  

--- 12. The Storyspinner (The Keepers' Chronicles, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-09-08

The summary basically tells the entire story. A performer dies, daughter trying to make things okay for family, ends up having to work for annoying (and handsome) Duke or whatever rich guy. Dead girls turn up that look just like performer, who just so happen to be the lost dead princess. Right there, you know the girl and guy gonna fall in love and this girl is the princess. There will probably be some "suspense" about it but it won't really be that dramatic since it's all in the summary. That I hate. When the summary pretty much tells you the story without even reading it, it's almost like what's the point of reading? I also hate the fact that of course they have to put that the rich guy is handsome. Yeah, he's annoying or frustrating or however it's worded, but they also have to put in that he's handsome. That's something that is so important! *rolls eyes* Can we describe a guy-especially in a summary-that isn't handsome? Ugh, it turned me off of the book a bit. The book was more of a setup to something that never happened. It's building up and building up and nothing happens. NOTHING. A couple few small fights but nothing major. It's all build up for nothing. It basically just ends up telling you what you already knew from the summary. Seriously, they don't really announce that the girl is the princess until the end. Like you didn't already know that... It even ends building up to something that will most likely not happen in the next book because let's just milk this for all its worth. I hate all the build up for nothing. And how in the world did this girl get so amazing at hunting or whatever she was doing in the beginning after just a couple months? To the point where the duke says it's a good shot. Seriously? Who taught her this? No one. She's just that gifted? That special? I seriously needed a map as well. There's no good description of what's going on and I need a map so I can at least look at what's going on. It's long, it's boring, it's anti-climatic, it's predictable and cliched. I read it, not sure if I'll read more, and I don't recommend it. It's not worth the time.

  

--- 13. The Orphan Queen (The Orphan Queen, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-09-03

Looks awesome and sounds awesome but lacks a bit. The world building kinda sucks-if there's really any. Was there a map? I don't remember. It's one of those been done before types of fantasy plots. Princess has to hide who she is, go undercover and blah blah blah. The plots and plans they do don't make sense. Or not completed as well as they should. Things just don't make sense. Characters are flat or fake. It's okay, average as a book. I may check out next one, but might not. It won't be a big thing either way.

  

--- 14. Go Set a Watchman (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-09-03

I wanted to read this but ended up dreading this book. I almost stopped reading it several times but just ended up skimming it. It's just all kinds of wrong. The characters are blah and not interesting. The plot seems pointless. It drags on and does nothing but annoy the reader. And that's all I'll say cause I don't want to think about this anymore.

  

--- 15. Daughter of Deep Silence (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-09-03

What this book was basically about: Frances got the hots for some guy she met on a cruise ship but had to hide who she was. Years later, she finds him and still got the hots for him but she's on this "revenge plot" that doesn't go as smoothly as planned but as long as she's got him, it's all good. It sounded like a good plot. Revenge for a crime unpunished. Grey and his Senator father survived a cruise ship and said it was from a rouge wave that killed everyone. Frances and Libby survived as well, though Libby dies right before they're rescued, and Frances knows they're lying-everyone died from gunmen. It sounds like Frances and Libby know each other so well, but how when they've only been together a few days on a cruise ship. Grey and Frances love each other so much, though they've only spent a short amount of time together. When they were 14. 14 people! That is not old enough to know you are so in love that you'll never forget them and never be the same without them. Frances can act like Libby so well except when she can't-which is always. Shepherd who is so in love with Libby knows Frances is not Libby because of how she places her towel. Let that soak in: how she places her towel. I don't even know what to say about that. It's supposed to be a revenge story. It's a story who got the hots for a guy and wants to be with him. That's it.

  

--- 16. The Clockwork Scarab (Stoker & Holmes, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-09-03

I'm at a loss of words here. I can't decide if I want to give it a one star or two star rating. (1.5 really) It sounds interesting. Mina, niece of Sherlock Holmes, and Evaline, a vampire hunter, thrown together trying to find out what's going on with missing ladies. Add in a time traveler from our time into a sorta steampunk Victorian England and it sounds interesting. Key word being sounds. Mina thought she was so smart and she has history of being able to determine what's going on with her family and what not, but she's not. She's more full of herself. The detective gets what's going on just as well as she does and she doesn't think things correctly either. Evaline is supposed to be strong and a warrior but it seems like a front really. She's afraid of blood. And towards the end, when there's action going on, she doesn't do much of anything. She also conveniently happens to get all her good information from Pix, a guy she keeps randomly running into, but knows all the answers and knows who she is. There's something going on with that, but whatever. Dylan seemed like a random thrown in point that didn't make much sense. Though I kinda wish they had a random chapter with his POV because I don't know half of what was going on or what they were talking about. Maybe that's because it was boring, maybe because it didn't make sense, maybe because I skimmed so much of it because I couldn't handle reading much more of it. Honestly, it read more like a random fanfic with Stoker vampire hunters, Sherlock Holmes family, time travel, and a dash of Egyptian mythology thrown in. A crazy mixed up story. Makes no sense. Not sure if I'll read more of it, but maybe...

  

--- 17. Made You Up (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-08-23

I enjoyed this book. Alex is a senior, who can't tell what's real and what's not. She thinks she gets things under control, but it turns out, not so much. She's just trying to be a normal teenager in high school without problems. The characters that she believes are real, some turn out to not be real. I think the execution of it all was done well. It makes the reader believe that they're real, even if it's just in Alex's head.

Rated 1/5 on 2015-08-23

Loved the first book, but this wasn't as exciting. It was just cliche after cliche after predictability over and over again. I could tell what was going to happen from the beginning. It was frustrating how everything was.

  

--- 19. Stolen Songbird (The Malediction Trilogy, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-08-23

Gotta love the fact that it's not an insta-love like most young adult books are. But I have no idea what these trolls/fairies look like. I say fairies because that's what they really are. Honestly. There's no real description about the trolls besides they look odd, they have magic or some do, and maybe a couple other phrases. But for the most part, there's no description of them. As the story went on, it felt more like fairies than trolls but were called trolls by humans because they were "evil" or something. Towards the end of the book, it seems like that's the case. It wasn't bad, but it got annoying and just setting up for a trilogy, which I'm getting tired of. While I was reading it, I felt like most of the problems would have been solved if they talked it out instead of hiding things. But of course, they can't talk because that would resolve the problems too easily.

  

--- 20. Liars, Inc. (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-08-23

Interesting enough, but overall, falls flat. The whole premise behind it sounds interesting enough, but as the story goes on, it fails to live up to what it is. It's not that interesting and it lacks a lot of things, such as common sense, character development, how people would act in friendships, etc. It's just no.

  

--- 21. Alive (The Generations Trilogy, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-08-14

I wish this book would decide what it wants to do. It's described as teenagers doing all this crap, but the entire time they're twelve years old. Not really, but that's what they think they are. They probably look more like seventeen year olds since they're all hot and sexy. (Seriously, everyone is described as hot. Why does everyone have to be described as hot?) It drags on too much and not much goes on. There's just walking and talking and arguing about who is going to be the leader and walking and so on. The end seems to get a bit more excited, but it's really not. It's more anticlamtic. It's just eh overall. I can't say too much more because that would spoil the book and there is a little something that's different and I think should be saved, if you want to read it. I don't think I'd read on. It's just no.

  

--- 22. Ignite (Defy, #2) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-08-14

I think I enjoyed Defy, but to be honest, I'm not entirely sure. It's been a while and I don't remember much of it. And that's frustrating because I don't remember half the characters mentioned at first or what happened in the last book and it takes a while to get back invested into the story and characters. (This is why there's a general summary of what happened in most sequel books.) The world building just sucks. It doesn't make sense together or flow right. And I so wish there was a map to figure things out, but there's not. I wanted this story to be about Alexa and being awesome and what not. What I got was every time she thought about being awesome, she then turned her attention to Damian and how she loves him but can't tell him because that's not right and maybe she should go to Rylan instead and she still loves Damian. (It gets old fast.) Then evil pretty lady comes in and she's so beautiful so she must be evil! That's pretty much the reasoning for Alexa. That she's so pretty and all the guys are eyeing her, so therefore pretty lady is evil. Granted, she is, but there had to be a better reason than she's pretty so I hate her. It was so cliched! It's predictable. There's twists that are expected. Nothing is too much of a shock. Alexa doesn't think about things too much or communicate like she should and that gets her into trouble. And I can see that continuing into the next book. It's not bad for some of it, but half of the book is all about falling for a guy and half has action. Can we just have it consistent?

  

--- 23. All the Rage (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-08-02

All the Rage follows the story of Romy after she is raped by the Sheriff's son, Kellan. No one believes what she says so she builds up a wall around herself and shuts everyone out. I thought it was an interesting story. Focusing on Romy after her rape. It's a strong topic that not many touch and I thought it wasn't too bad. Popular guy rapes a girl and no one believes it or wants to because he's a popular guy. It might be because of how Romy acts, but she wasn't a likeable character too much. She was okay, but I wasn't crazy about her. There's a bunch of hate, but it's eh, whatever. One thing that really bother me was that the summary was not the same as the book. The first half of the summary about the rape, yes, that's there. But it says that a girl with ties to Romy and Kellan disappear and news about Kellan assaulting a girl from another town gets out. And Romy has to decide if she wants to speak up or not. No. There is ONE LINE about a girl from another town and not even exactly saying Kellan assaulted her. Just he's bad news. Or be careful with him. I was thinking there was going to be more, but there's not. And it's not so much Romy deciding to speak up or not. Unless you count the ending where she says something, but not official. There's also supposed to be a shocking conclusion... I'm not seeing it. The writing was also a bit stiff. Most of it was, I did this, I did that, I this, I that, etc. It got old after a while. I think the topic was good, the idea was good, the characters blah, the romance too soon, the writing blah, and the summary misleading. Not bad overall, but not something I would rush out and buy either.

  

--- 24. The Girl at Midnight (The Girl at Midnight, #1) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-07-10

Looking at reviews, a lot of people are saying it's very similar to Daughter of Smoke and Bone. I can't say that I've read that because I don't remember reading it. Did this book still seem familiar? Yes. But so are tons of other books. I don't think I've read an actual original book in some time. Even more with fantasy. But, this plot follows the story of Echo, who is a human, and is close with the Avicen (bird people living in the world) who are at war with dragon people (I forgot their name...) Everyone is in search of the Firebird because that will solve the problems and win the war. I swear, as I'm reading this, I'm thinking of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Caius is the Dragon Prince and his sister, Tanith, wants the throne and-spoiler-steals it from him. She's also more evil than he is, can breath fire and a bit more deadlier than he is with that, she's younger, underhanded, and will do whatever it takes to get what she wants. I think the only thing missing from Tanith to be Azula was the hair. Tanith is a blond and Azula has black hair. Also, war has been going on for some time and everyone is looking for the Firebird which seems so impossible that it's a legend and doubtful it'll be found. Turns out (not surprisingly) it's a person and not a thing. So everyone is hunting a person, though they don't know it at first. And the person has "past lives" from people who were the Firebird or could have been the Firebird but didn't complete what they had to bring it out. Basically, the Fire Dragon Prince is in search of the Avatar Firebird after a war that's been going on for years because that will end the war. I liked the fact that Echo didn't automatically fall for hot guy because he was there helping her. He was an enemy, but helping her at that time-enemy of my enemy is my friend-but she didn't trust him. She saves his life and she questions why she did that. She doesn't understand. And I like that, that it's not oh I should or oh yeah, I'm falling for you. It's, for some reason I'm saving your life but I hate you. You are my enemy. It's not love or romance, it's almost gaining the trust. It's baby steps. The dialogue was funny at times. The details were pretty good. Some of the characters weren't bad. It's interesting once it finally gets into the story. However, it's slow at first and takes a bit to get into the story. Some of the characters are not interesting or developed enough. Not to mention it's not original at all. It's cliched and predictable. You can tell what's going to happen before it even really starts. It's a mesh of so many other stories, which is disappointing. I don't want to read something and say that's like this book or that book or that show or whatever. And I was saying that to almost everything in here. It's also a series, which is getting old. Just once I'd like to read a fantasy book that was just one book and not a series.

  

--- 25. The Secrets We Keep (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-07-01

So I hated and enjoyed this book. Doesn't make much sense, but yeah. The story follows Ella and Maddy who are twins and one dies after a car accident. Ella. However, she pretends to be her sister after a mistaken identity. In theory, this would work. That is, if you think about it as a sister grieving for her sister. How she has to grieve and act like everything is okay but it's not. However, if you think of it like how it is, it's kinda stupid. Being your sister because you got into a fight and you feel she deserves to live? I get that you feel bad about what happened, but she deserves a life more so than you? Not to mention no one recognizes that Ella is Ella and not Maddy? Or, how about the personality is completely different as in Maddy is the cliched popular one and Ella is the cliched nerdy one? Then it gets to the whole reason behind it. The reason for Ella doing what she's doing starts to have more holes and less sense. Finally when it's out that Ella is Ella, everyone is just okay with it. Nothing about how Ella was mean to do that. Or shouldn't have done it. Or anything. It's just glossed over. The emotions weren't as strong as they could have been either. I mean, this is about your twin sister dying here and everyone is just eh, oh wow, bummer. I will say I read it quickly and it did keep me interested at least. Even though it was lacking. Interesting idea, not so much execution.

  

--- 26. A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-07-01

Just ugh... It was okay, but annoying and frustrating at the same time. It started out okay with Feyre having to support her family and she's the only one who can do anything, but her sisters aren't really appreciative of it and her father is a bum, basically. I mean, he's handicapped so he can't do much, but he could do some yet he doesn't and he just stares out into space. Anyways, Feyre ends up killing a wolf who isn't a wolf but actually a Fae. The punishment for that is her life, but the fae who finds her, Tamlin, says he'll let her live if she lives with him. She takes it cause she'll still be alive. Turns out, she's there just to live in a life of luxury. And everything there is exquisite. EVERYTHING IS DESCRIPED AS EXQUISITE. After a page of this, it's old and I'm asking for new words. Like, maybe SHOW us how it's exquisite instead of telling us that it's exquisite or beautiful or whatever. But that's what Sarah does, you think it'll be this epic hardcore book, when all you get is pretty stuff. Moving on, everyone hides things from Feyre because they can't tell her a thing. It's forbidden or whatever. So, basically, the reader knows nothing because Feyre knows nothing. Now, that might seem like a good idea for the reader so they have surprises later on, but it's not in this case. There is NOTHING mentioned. The plot isn't even really discussed because they can't tell Feyre anything. So half the book is nothing but Feyre asking questions which no one answers. Apparently it's also supposed to be some twist on Beauty and the Beast, with fae instead. It would work except that Tamlin, who is supposed to be the best, is freaking handsome. Feyre mentions how good he looks and how even better he'll look without the mask, so how is that a beast? Feyre is supposed to hate the fae and then all of a sudden, she's getting the hots for Tamlin. She's hardly around him and hates him, but then she wants to make out with him. It jumps from pure hate for the race to lust for him. With no explanation. There's just too much frustration with it. It's dull, boring, insta-love, just blah, dragging on, doesn't mention the plot, and love triangle crap. There's hints of a love triangle and Feyre doesn't think things through. Of course there's going to be another book and no doubt there will be that love triangle stronger because that's what everyone does-multiple books and love triangles. Why can't we just have one book where there is no love triangle? Seriously? Overall, okay, but rather annoying. I have a feeling it'll just be dragged out just like her other series is...

  

--- 27. The Ables (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-06-17

The Ables follows Phillip, a blind telekinetic, and his band of misfit "superheroes" who all have disabilities as they learn more with their powers. And trying to improve though being handicapped. I liked the idea of this story. When I heard about it (from Jeremy on the CinemaSins channel) I thought it was interesting. Even if I hadn't heard about it from him, I would have checked it out. It's a superhero book and it's different. A blind telekinetic? How's that gonna work? For the most part, I enjoyed it. It was interesting, sorta different-in the fact that the MC has a disability that prevents him from using his power. I liked the variety of powers. Yes, there were some usual ones, but also different ones as well. But there were flaws. Everything is cliched in this book. EVERYTHING! It's obvious what's going to happen, who is going to do what, what surprises are in store, etc. The characters are cliched. The plot is cliched. Guy feels down that he's in a special class. Guy bands up with other special kids. Kids get bullied. Kids can't do game that everyone else is doing. Kids fight for it, kids win. Evil guy comes in and kids have to save day. First kids suck at it, then they start getting better. Phillip... he's blind and he finally gets a chance to see something. And suddenly he can read. And being able to see is just phased over quickly. I think maybe a couple paragraphs is glanced over about how awesome it is, but not much. I mean, this is a kid who hasn't seen and suddenly he can?! Where's the excitement? There's videos of people who hear for the first time and they're so emotional about it. Yet, nothing like that here. I guess vision isn't as important? How are 9th graders suddenly seniors? How can a person with one arm suddenly have two hands later on? How is it only a page or a little more is all there is needed for depression? Realizing the kid had it and just had to snap out of it and suddenly was? It wasn't just flaws like that that were in the book. There's also times where a new paragraph would be started mid sentence. The "Ooph" that was bold was not bold in a couple chapters. The "part 4" of ables that was on the page with a new chapter of every other parts was not on the same page. It was on the end of the previous chapter like it was part of that. There's quotations where they shouldn't be. It looked like there was some editing, but it wasn't consistent. Just like some characters. They were there, then not. It's more telling and not showing, which was disappointing. Things were told to us about what happened and we weren't shown. I wanted to see them, but I was told about what happened later on. It was, this happened a (time length) ago and we're mentioning it now. Honestly, as bad as it was, I would drop the stars a bit more. However, I did enjoy the story. Though cliched, I kept reading it. I think it has potential. I'm interested in seeing if there is anything more with this book or from Jeremy. But I do hope that there is more editing involved. Otherwise, I'll just watch the youtube channel...

  

--- 28. The Heir (The Selection, #4) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-06-13

Just shot me now. Why do I have to torture myself so much? The Selection series dragged on and really should have been condensed into one book, IMO. They didn't have an ending at each book, it just dragged on and on. Of course, this is the same way, with a non-ending ending. Because guess what, Princess doesn't choose anyone. I'll save you that trouble now. I really shouldn't have read this, but I just wanted to check it out since it was different and I thought maybe it would be better... One word that sums up the horrid this book is: Eadlyn. I should have said no once I read the first paragraph, but I didn't. I knew it would be trouble and I kept going. I was heading into my own doom, I know. It starts out with Eadlyn whining about how one day she has to rule the country and that's such a burden for her. Because her parents fought to have their daughter rule since she was born before her brothers. Poor her. That should sum up everything about her. But basically, she's spoiled, whiny, childish, rude, arrogant, controlling, manipulative, shallow, and the list goes on. By the way, how in the world could her parents-one who was really sweet-create her and let her grow up like that? The book doesn't get much better as she's forced into a Selection and automatically cuts a bunch of guys, some just because they looked at her funny or she was bored with them. She refuses to even feel anything for anyone and ends up turning into a robot. How could she feel for anyone anyways? She's going to rule. She doesn't need anyone. (I really want to smack her hard) She's rude to everyone, including her maid-even insulting her. She starts to feel things and leaves the situation right away. She can't feel. Finally, it looks like she starts to improve and nope, it's a lie. Every step she takes forward, she takes two back. The MC should improve as the book goes on, mature, learn, grow, etc. But she doesn't. She's selfish and doesn't care. Think I'm lying? Towards the end, she tries to convince her twin brother to break up with the love of his life because she doesn't want him leaving her. He ends up leaving anyways and says that he knows if he stayed, she would convince him to stay and rule for her. She's pissed that he left her because that's exactly what she wanted to do. Now she doesn't have anyone to pass her "work" to. She thinks about "poor" her and not how happy she should be for her brother. Also, the work of ruling and what not that she's supposed to be so busy with is nonexistent. There is no work. I don't know why she complains. Oh wait... I do, it's just her. This series is just becoming making money and not writing. I'm so frustrated and annoyed, but at least I know one thing for sure. I don't care how tempted or how interesting it seems, I'm not reading another book by Kiera.

  

--- 29. Prisoner of Night and Fog (Prisoner of Night and Fog, #1) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-06-13

Prisoner of Night of Fog follows the story of Gretchen who is in Hitler's "inner circle", close enough where Hitler is her "Uncle" and like her father, and Daniel who is a Jewish reporter. Gretchen wants nothing to do with Daniel because he's a "dirty Jew" and "evil". But Daniel knows something about her history she doesn't. First off, I love the fact that it's a third person story! I think I'm sick of first person YA stories... I enjoyed the history and that it went more into the beginning of Hitler and his rise. It didn't focus on that too much, but it did have it woven throughout the story. Gretchen and Daniel explore what happened to her father when he died. She assumed it was during a fight, protecting Hitler, but the more they look into it, the more it's a murder. I loved how they built their relationship. The more Gretchen spent with Daniel, the more she realized she shouldn't have hate for Jews and maybe Hitler was wrong. (love that) There was trust and friendship and then stronger feelings started coming. (Not love at first sight!) I liked how Gretchen started learning about psychology about Hitler and her brother. Why they are the way they are. (I love stories like that too.) It didn't make so much sense why Daniel was so willing to help Gretchen. Even if he was a reporter and looking for a story, that doesn't make a person stay with another when they despise you. A couple other characters were random and didn't make much sense, but whatever. Overall, it was good. I enjoyed it.

  

--- 30. Conspiracy of Blood and Smoke (Prisoner of Night and Fog, #2) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-06-13

When I first saw Prisoner of Night and Fog, I thought it sounded interesting and I couldn't wait to read Conspiracy of Blood and Smoke. This is 1930s Germany with a Jew and someone in Hitler's party after all. What's not to love? (I love history and when there's conflict like this.) This takes place where Gretchen and Daniel were in England and Daniel gets pulled back into Germany and can't leave because he's wanted for murder. Gretchen, of course, has to go to Germany and find what's going on. Between the two of them, they have a limited amount of time to solve who killed the woman Daniel is framed for, prove Hitler and his party are evil, and escape. There is a lot of murder mystery going on here, which I liked. I like mystery, I like wondering who did it. Even though it's pretty obvious who, they just had to find out why. And proof. Things do fall into place a lot easier for Gretchen than I would have expected. After all, this is 1933 Germany, he's a wanted Jew, she's on the run from Hitler's inner circle-how are they not in more trouble than they are? It's not as climatic as I would have thought. It's more...eh. I liked it and the first book was awesome, but this wasn't as dramatic. It fell more flat. I mean, it was good and I enjoyed it, but the first was a lot better. This, things just happened too easily and solved too quickly and the ending was just anticlimactic. I liked the fact that they kept with the fact about how much time they had left. Most books, it seems like time does not match everything they do. But this mentioned how much time was left. While that was good, it was also bad because it mentioned it over and over again. The same with other things-they're repeated over and over. Such as he's a Jew, she was with Hitler, Hitler taught her well, she doesn't want to think about Hitler, etc. It gets old. How many times does she have to repeat the same thing over and over again? Still, overall, I enjoyed it. I'm curious to see if there is more to this series and what else Anne has.

  

--- 31. Miss Mayhem (Rebel Belle, #2) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-04-22

This really suffers from second book syndrome. It seems like it'll be interesting and good, but it's not. It's really not. It's too anti-climatic. Here's the plot: Harper has to go through tests to stay as the Paladin. The tests are supposed to be hard and tough and she may not live. The tests in reality: a fire at school where she hits the Principal to save David, and going through a maze seeing those she cares about not close to her or something. It's just...eh? That's supposed to be super hard and threaten her life? Seriously? Other than that, there's not much action-or pretty much none at all-and it's eh overall. The bad guys turn good guys and apparently, there's only one left and not as many as thought to be, which doesn't make sense, especially with the first book. And the ending makes me wonder if there is going to be another book or not. It doesn't seem like it. It just ends with everyone in separate places. Honestly, I don't think this book was worth being out. It's a waste.

  

--- 32. Red Rising (Red Rising, #1) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-04-22

This was described as a mix of Hunger Games and Game of Thrones. And, well, it pretty much is. There's death, blood, gore, violence, and the intrigue/political/whatever you want to call it of Game of Thrones. It's like a teenager version of the two on Mars. Simply put, that's what it was. I hadn't heard about this book until I read Red Queen and had heard people mention that it was a crappy copy of Red Rising (which it is, it really is). I'm glad I checked out Red Rising. It's different, interesting and unique. Now, that doesn't mean it's the best book out there. There were some things that I just didn't understand. I don't know if it's I read too fast, it's not explained, or because it's in first person and in first person, they aren't going to explain or describe things as well. Which, I think, is a problem with first person POV in books like these. When it's futuristic or dystopian, it's hard to understand everything because they don't explain it to a person from this generation. It may be the same thing as we use today, but if it's called something else or described differently, it's not the same. If it was done in third person, the writer can describe it so we, as readers, understand. Also, with stories like this, when it's first person, it's pretty obvious who the winner is going to be. You don't even have to know there's a competition going on but that he will win. It's anti-climatic because the first person POV isn't going to die or not win. Overall, not bad, but not the best.

  

--- 33. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-04-13

The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is told by an autistic boy. I thought that was interesting and different. It's not something you read all the time. However, I couldn't get into the book. The entire time it's all "this happened, then this, then this" and so on. It was too stiff and no fluidity to it. It was random and didn't follow the same track. I tried, I did, but I couldn't finish reading it. It was getting too annoying and I dreaded picking it up to read. If you can get past the stiff reading, I say go for it.

  

--- 34. China Dolls (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-04-13

I've read a few books by Lisa See and it seems like they're all the same. I didn't mind China Dolls too much, as it was during more time and with different characters instead of just one, but it was really the same as her other books. The three Chinese (or, two Chinese and one Japanese pretending to be Chinese during WWII and after) dancers were pretty much the same. Ruby was concerned only with herself and too selfish. Grace was a bit slow. And Helen was too selfish or conniving, I guess. Can't think of the right words. The thing that Lisa See does is try to write characters to make them more human and realistic, which is awesome and I'm glad she does. However, she gives them the flaws that make them annoying and where no one cares about. The flaws that were supposed to ground them, made me not like them. Plus, it seemed like they only stuck together because they said they were going to and no other reason. There wasn't that friendship there. It was all forced. It would have been nice if Lisa showed more to their friendship than just "we here and supposed to like each other so... yeah..." Not great, not too bad, but eh overall.

  

--- 35. The Forgotten Sisters (Princess Academy, #3) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-03-22

I'm putting this as romance because the series has some romance, but it's not that strong. After all, it's a MG book and not a YA book. Overall, I think it's a cute book. I like the series. It's one of those books you can read quickly. Like at the beach or something. Light reading, but still cute. Yes, it still has some flaws, but it's cute. I'm not as harsh on the flaws because it's a MG book and they can get away with more flaws. The story fits the audience. Yes, I'm older than the audience, but I like Shannon Hale and her books. They're fluffy and cute, like cotton candy. I'm also wondering if there is going to be more of these books. A spin off perhaps?

  

--- 36. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-03-22

I swear I have read this book years ago. That wouldn't be surprising considering I read books (sometimes without realizing it) again. There will be a certain point in the book where I realize I've read it and stop reading. That didn't happen with this book. I kept reading, going, I know I've read this. I must have. But it didn't really hit me that I did. I think I know why. I tried to block it out. It's the story of Lily and her "old same" Snow Flower. Which is basically two girls who are forced to be best friends and there for each other better than a sister. (Probably more than that, but that's a close enough gist to work.) At first, these two girls were okay and it was nice too see the two of them grow together and be close throughout their lives. As the book progressed, I found I disliked the main character. She was annoying and stupid. I understand not getting everything, because there are times where I don't get everything. But as it progressed, it seemed she didn't understand anything. Simple things she didn't get. It was obvious, but she didn't get it. A lot of problems that happened could have been avoided if there was communication, but Lily just got stubborn and refused to talk. I understand when someone hurts you, you want to avoid them, but the best way to get over everything and clear the air is to talk to them and find out what happened. But Lily was so stuck in her own world she refused to do so. Then, when Snow Flower is dying, Lily acts like she's the better person and helping Snow Flower, but it's just because Lily wants to act like she's the better person. It's not from the heart. It's not forgiveness. I think this book should have been done in third person instead of first. I probably would have been okay with the characters more so. As it was, I didn't like them, I found them annoying, the story dragged and seemed boring at times. Just not worth it.

  

--- 37. Gates of Thread and Stone (Gates of Thread and Stone #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-03-22

I try not to not finish books anymore. I used to do that often if I couldn't get into one. I try to last longer, or even finish it. This one, I gave up after about fourteen or fifteen chapters. It had it chance but it was too boring and slow. And really, if there is nothing going for it in fifteen chapters, there isn't going to be anything going on at all. Kai has this power of time, which would be cool, but it's not. Supposedly she can manipulate time and no one will notice or something. Question about that though: how come her brother knew? When she first did something with time, no one else knew about it. They all went about their days like usual. Except her brother. Her brother knew what day it should have been and that it was all because of Kai. How? If no one knows or can sees her do it, how does he know? Whatever. Maybe it's explained later on, but it was too much to try to get into. Too dull and boring.

  

--- 38. Vanishing Girls (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-03-22

The story sounded good enough and I've read other books by Lauren which were okay, so I decided to give this a try. As I'm reading this, I realize something. I've read this story before. Same idea, same basic plot, same twist, same... pretty much everything. That annoyed me about this book. I know there are a lot of books out there and it's hard to be different and unique (just look at all the dystopian books which are just copies of each other) but this had a different plot. It wasn't one that you would normally come across all the time. As I'm reading, the plot twists and "surprises" that are there are expected. From the first third, I can pretty much figure out how this is going to end, which was disappointing to say the least. Speaking of the plot, the second half of the book does not go with the first half. The second half, which has a major plot twist in it, makes the first half void. Basically, things in the first half don't make sense or can't exist as it says. I can't say much more than that because it's a huge spoiler to say what it is. But it ruins the book when the book makes plot holes as it goes along. Of course it also happened to have a love triangle with it. The two sisters were into the same guy and he's into the sisters. It's really not surprising. Overall, not impressive. Read it before. Nothing new or exciting. Just all disappointing.

  

--- 39. The Last Time We Say Goodbye (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-03-07

I've seen so many in love with this book and crying and being so emotional that I figured why not? It sounded good. But I guess it's one of those not for me type of things. It's not bad, but it's not great either. It was sad, but I wasn't tearing up or crying over it. The story is basically about Alexis's life after her brother committed suicide. She's sad and depressed. Her mother drinks. That's pretty much it. I don't think there was much more than that because the plot wasn't that strong. I think people cried because towards the end, what's written is written to make people cry. The way it's written and the words used is the generic way to make someone cry. If it was in a different book, it would make the reader cry as well. It wasn't unique, is what I'm saying. I've read those type of phrases before. Alexis sort of rubbed me the wrong way as well. She's a nerd, so that was neat, but she was a stuck up nerd. As in, anyone who isn't the same level IQ is stupid and must be made fun of. Cheerleaders are stupid. Dumb people are stupid. Anyone who wants to watch movies instead of read are stupid. Yeah, I can think the same thing, but I don't want to read my characters like that. I'm not a snob, because I also don't really care. If someone isn't as smart, whatever. I prefer to read, but I'm not going to make fun of someone who doesn't want to. Not crazy about cheerleaders, but whatever your passion is... But Alexis was the stuck up snob who thinks she's better than anyone else and that annoyed me. I think what bothered me was that there was no connection. I didn't feel anything for these characters and don't care. I don't care what happens to them. I think the MC was annoying, and that didn't help when it's her POV. It's a basic, generic story that has basic, generic words and feelings. Nothing new or unique. Overall, a 2.5 star.

  

--- 40. Invaded (Alienated, #2) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-03-07

So I enjoyed this book, but I also have issues with it as well. I'm also currently wondering if there's going to be a third book. It starts out pretty much right after the first book. Aelyx and Cara are on different planets. Aelyx on earth and Cara on L'eihr. Both of them have a lot of crap they have to deal with and people trying to kill them or get them discredited. The both of them talk through "phone calls", of sorts, to each other and hardly mention what's going on because they don't want the other to worry. I liked the fact that Cara was on a different planet and trying to adjust to that life. But then it just seemed like normal high school, only tougher, so that was a bit disappointing. Not much difference in that. I missed the interaction between Aelyx and Cara. Yes, they did talk, but it wasn't in person. It was over calls. It wasn't the same. I liked it (I think I did) in the first book and it was lacking here. I think that made me not enjoy the book as much. Instead of that romance, they decided to have Syrine (which no one liked after first book) and a human security guy David. Syrine hates humans, but because he saved her life, she starts feeling emotional towards him. David has the hots for her. But for Syrine to drastically change her feelings for him is random. It goes from hating to loving. And David and Aelyx keep talking about how to get Syrine into David. Not cool. It's like they were tricking her. Wasn't crazy about that. It just progressed so quickly too. It goes from she hates everyone to having sex with David. Totally different than what I thought she was going to do. Random note, I was a bit confused about time here. Syrine mentions only a month to see Cara for Aelyx, but then next chapter for Cara, she mentions around 50 days till she sees him again. Which is it? Jaxen is such a creeper. He's hitting on Cara some kind of bad, and she gets the bad vibes from him, but not that he likes her. Or may like her. There's just all these creepy situations she gets in with him and it's just uncomfortable to read. Cara's parents are seriously lacking in this book. In the first one, there was more emphasis on the family and the parents involved. This one didn't really have too much of them. Cara barely thought of them. It did have more of her brother and more of relationship with him, so I guess that's what we get instead of the parents? The ending was, well, blah. It was disappointing and rushed. It wasn't as good as I hoped or expected. Too quick, too neat, too rushed. Still, I enjoyed this book and will read the next one, if there's another one. I think this book suffered more from second book syndrome than anything else.

  

--- 41. Trust Me, I'm Lying (Trust Me, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-02-28

I should have enjoyed this book. I should have loved this book. I love crime books, con artists, etc. This had them in it. But that's about it. It starts out cliched with the "This is my name, but not my name". Then goes into the "best grifter" right behind father. That sentence is supposed to prepare you for how awesome Julep is. It's not. For the best grifter, she's stupid. No wait, she's smart. Because she goes to smart classes. She's an "A" student. So she's smart. At least we're TOLD she's smart. But it's not shown. You know what is? She's stupid. She doesn't read people at all. Not like she's supposed to be able to. A guy she hardly knows helps her with school and because he's "hot", therefore she spills all her secrets. And no, it doesn't go well for her. Cause she's not smart. But she's been doing this for years so she knows what she's doing. No. She's doing it for maybe five years. She's fifteen. Her first job was at ten. When she disguised herself as an old man and went into a bar where her father was. Right. Because obviously someone who has no practice whatsoever is going to be able to pull off a costume, accent, attitude, etc so much so that they can slide in unnoticed and get a drink, all the while the father (the BEST grifter out there, mind you) had no idea that's his daughter right next to him. That should tell you how good and smart these people are right there. Other books I've read don't have the person starting out like that with no help. And they don't go out on their own with no training either. They also been doing it a lot longer as well. But I guess Julep has to one up everyone and be so awesome at it. So, Sam, who is Julep's best friend is in love with Julep. And Julep, who is the BEST grifter out there, HAS NO IDEA OF ANY OF THIS. How can you call yourself the best grifter when you can't even read your best friend? But suddenly, Mr. Hot Guy comes in and she gets all weak in the knees and tells him all her secrets. Because she "can't help herself". Of course she realizes her mistake later on when Mr. Hot Guy and parent happen to come in and tell the mob everything she was saying is a lie. That's why you don't trust people. They lie. But you're the best grifter, surely you should have seen that. Also, there is no way a fifteen year old could pass as someone who is thirty. I don't care if there is supposed to be some believability to this or people will see what they want to see or whatever else Julep tried to throw, it's bull. You can look at someone and tell they too young. Everything just was too convenient in this book as well. This person just so happened to conveniently be there at the right time, they just conveniently heard the right thing, and so on. I can't stand that many conveniences because it doesn't happen. Speaking of which, how in the world does a guy who has been shot several times survive after weeks of being who knows where? The mob believed him dead. He should have been dead. Yet, he's alive. Love to know how and what's been keeping him alive or what he ate. I know, convenience. The writing was juvenile. The characters were cliched and confused. The plot lacked common sense. It's frustrating. And of course, there's a second book. Because everyone is doing trilogies, why not make more books about the stupid grifter who can't read people and really bad about pulling cons that make no sense at all.

  

--- 42. The Princess Spy (Hagenheim, #5) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-02-28

I've read other books by Melanie but just couldn't get into them. They sound good by the description, but it's just not good reading. I heard this and thought I'd give it a try. But I gave up. After over 100 pages, I couldn't do it anymore. I skimmed some and read the ending, but I just couldn't get into it. I think it was the writing was just flat. They did this, they did that. Blah, blah, blah. I'm not connected to the characters. I don't care if one succeeds or one fails. It was just too cliched and too predictable. Right away I knew what was going to happen. Maybe that's why I didn't care if I finished reading or not. When I did read the end I was just, oh, yeah, figured that out. Too generic, too cliched, too predictable, too much telling and not enough showing all make for a bad story.

  

--- 43. Shanghai Girls (Shanghai Girls #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-02-28

This is one of those books that you can like, but be very aggravated with. Why? Because it lacks so much. Like connection. And feeling. And an ending. Shanghai Girls starts out with Pearl and May, sisters living in Shanghai, posing as beautiful girls, who find out their family is broke and they now have arranged marriages. They do as they're told because they were raised Chinese and told to respect their parents, even though they are a bit "modern" and figure they're get out of it later on. Bad things happen because of this. The family is threatened, they now have to leave and Japan is bombing China. Fleeing to America is pretty much the only thing they have to do, which is something they didn't want to because that was where their husbands were. Along the way there's a bunch of bad things that happen and when they get to America, they have bad things happen. That's basically what happens. And basically how the story is told. This happened. This happened. This happened. And Pearl is jealous of May, Pearl loves that Z guy, May knows this and ends up sleeping with him. Because why not? I just hate these characters. There's no connection to them at all. Bad things happen to Pearl and I'm just like eh, oh well. I don't feel anything to them. I don't think Pearl really feels anything about what's going on. The way it's written, it doesn't seem like there's a connection there. It's a rape and all you're going to say is "I was raped". But then it's also because you're stupid and don't listen. Mom was trying to save Pearl and she doesn't listen. (No, I'm not saying rape is okay at all. But in this case it could have been prevented if Pearl listened) The timing in this book is random. The first half goes into detail about what happened and it's not rushed or skipping several months. Then it goes from years and years ahead. In one sentence, Joy skips two grades. There's no consistency here. Yes, I understand it's going to go over several years, but make it even. There's supposed to be this deep connection between Pearl and May because they're sisters, but it's told to us. Not shown. And whenever they want to say how close they are, it's more, we love each other or we hate each other we love each other. My sister is my best friend and we don't act like these two do. The lack of ending frustrated me. It was obvious what was going to happen and it was like Lisa decided she just wanted to end it and finish it in a second book. That's fine if you do, but don't leave it on a crappy non-ending. End it. Have the book completed. I did like the history. But it was just too frustrating to really enjoy.

  

--- 44. Of Monsters and Madness (Of Monsters and Madness, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-02-20

Browsing through my library shelves, I came across this book. It says a historical retelling of classic Gothic horror featuring Edgar Allen Poe and I'm like, good, good. I love me some Poe, I love history, and gothic just makes things better. (Most of the time.) However, this book was just, eh, at best. It starts with rain (a bad thing to start with) and Annabel traveling to her father's house in Philly. (Moving-bad thing to start with as well) Murders are happening in the city before Annabel comes, so why is it a good thing she lives with her father? Because she's safe there! Apparently... Question: She finds out she has a grandfather and she's surprised about that. If that's the case, why does she already have a gift for him when she arrived? Was she going to give two to her father and decided against it? Question: Why did her mother leave her father? I'm assuming they were married, so that would have been scandalous at that time period. Did her father not care before? Why was it so long they were away? Yes, they do say that grandfather couldn't find them when they went to Siam, but all those years before? Blah, blah, blah, nothing much happens except Annabel feels all depressed about disappointing her father because she's not a good lady. She wants to do medicine yet her father says no! And what is she to do? She also starts hanging out with Allen. And there's all kinds of scandalous behavior during that time. She is alone with him, though she knows she shouldn't be. They're touching, kissing, and even using first names. I believe (but I could be wrong) that during that time period, they didn't use their first names until they were better acquainted. Like related acquainted. That doesn't seem to bother her. Random thing: her scarf that she wears, she always wears it. Her mother said never take it off. Then never take off in front of others. Then never off. Then in front of people. Which is it? You can't have both. The conflict was frustrating. But apparently, it's there to hide a mark on her neck. Not sure what that's about, but it reminds me of "The Madman's Daughter" and I'm wondering if there's going to be something like that later on in one of the novels. There's a preface in there as well, but it's not needed because it's one of the later chapters. It's pointless to have in there twice. Towards the end, Edgar mentions framing Maddy, the servant, for the murder, but nothing happens. Annabel totally ignores that. Nothing happens to Maddy. What's that about? There's also a bunch grammatical errors. I can't be the only one who saw. There's a time when a question mark should be there, but it's a period. Commas are used when not needed. Really, it's like a bad mix of The Madman's Daughter, Poe, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and a few others. It's full of Poe, but the bad Poe and not good Poe. It was frustrating to read. It dragged on. I don't see a point of more books. I think whatever plot going towards further books could have just been added to this book or ignored. It could have ended. Instead it dragged on. All this would make me give it a one star rating, yet, there was a bit of romance. I didn't mind the romance here. It was pleasant. It showed how they grew closer. The beating heart worked for the time period. The sly hand movements and touching was flirting back then and that was nice. But it also went a bit scandalous for the time period and that ruined some of it. Still, two stars- 1 1/2 stars really. Doubt I'll read more from this author or next book.

  

--- 45. Red Queen (Red Queen, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-02-18

This story had potential. I was super excited for this book to come out. But it seems like it's just like every other dystopian out there. Shame. It starts off with Mare trying to survive when she finds out her best friend is going to the army because he lost his apprenticeship. She decides she's going to do something rash to save his life. She decides to steal enough to get the both of them out of town. Which wouldn't be too bad except Mare was already expecting to go to the army in a few months and she basically was fine with it, she didn't try to get out of it at least. She doesn't care about her family in this and doesn't tell her family at all about her stupid plan. Except her sister who she coerces to help her steal enough. That leads to her sister having her hand broken, which sucks because her sister was the only one that had a decent job for the future. Now, that's not gonna happen. Can't sew with a broken hand. Yet, Mare is so selfish, she's still trying to escape. But, luckily, she bumps into someone who helps her out. Turns out, it's the Prince, who gets her a job at the Palace. While there, she finds out, she's a special flower and has abilities. Thing is, she's a Red. Reds don't have powers. Silvers do. And they rule the world. The King and Queen have a plan. Have her lie and say she's some lost Lady, marry the second Prince, and she'll live. She decides she will as long as her family is safe from going to the army. Good deal, right? I kept wondering why she also didn't ask for a healer as well. You know, to heal her sister's hand? Or even to try something on her father with half a lung? Anyways, she lives her new life and maybe once or twice thinks about her family. But there's uprising! The lower class isn't happy! [insert everything you've heard from every dystopian] Of course Mare has to be in the middle of it as well. And, guess what? Her Prince fiance is as well! And the love triangle or square or whatever. It seems every guy that has a ten minute conversation or longer with Mare is suddenly in love with her and she sorta feels the same way. Who knows? The book focused on her feelings more than anything else. Does she like him? Does she not? Does he like her? Does he not? It's aggravating! I dislike love triangles because it's a waste. And this whole romance crap is a waste. All of it. It doesn't show any love between any of the characters. It's more telling us they like each other. That I hate more than love triangles. The telling how the characters feel. Don't tell me. Show me. Show me how their romance is blossoming. And don't have brothers the love interests for one girl. It's not pretty. Pretty early on in the book, I was hoping for a map. Things are described as north or south or around the river or something along those lines. However, there's nothing more than that. There's no real world building. I have no idea where they are or what's going on. I don't know how big the town is. Or how big anything is. Besides her saying it takes so many hours/days to get somewhere. A map would have been awesome. And world building. Red Queen tried to do so much, but it ended up just taking things from other books and throwing them into a pot and hoping it worked. It didn't. It was eh at best. I would rate it one star, but I kinda liked a bit of it. I think I might check out next book from the library and see how that is. Because of that, I'll give it two stars.

  

--- 46. The Treatment (The Program, #2) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-02-07

Ugh... I had trouble with this book. I loved the first book, couldn't wait for this one to come out. It picks up right from where the first one left off too. Either it's been so long since I read the first one I forgotten a few things or there was some decline in what I enjoyed about the first book. Half of the first book is about Sloane and James making out, wanting sex, not able to have sex because forgot condoms, and making out. They're also caught by some rebels who decide to take them out partying even though the rebels tell them Sloane and James are all over the news and wanted. That doesn't make sense. Like at all. If you're wanted, going around people is NOT going to help. Dallas, a rebel, is on a cell phone all the time. If they're rebels, how are they still using cell phones? How are they paying for cell phones? What is she doing on her cell phone? Updating her facebook status to say "still on run, will destroy the program #theprogramisevil"? I would think, if you're trying to avoid being caught, a cell phone that could be tracked is not a good idea. But that's just me. James annoys me so much. He gets to be such a huge baby. He starts breaking down and crying because while Sloane was in The Program, she was close to Realm. Even though it wasn't much and James probably didn't remember who Sloane was and she wasn't going to remember him in a couple days. I get it, she kissed him. That's upsetting. But you don't need to cry your eyes out over it. I don't like it when a male character gets like that. If you're upset, fine. But don't cry over something like that. She's with you now. What happened, happened. Blah, blah, blah, time passes and Sloane gets back into the Program. She tries to escape, but can't until James and Realm come to get her. Everything is very convenient in this book as well. Too convenient. Right before Sloane is going into surgery, she's saved! Yay! Really? The Program is ruined by Sloane and the news and that's it. Seriously. That's it. The good doctors talk to the media and suddenly The Program is done with. How? I have no idea. It's just gone and done. Everything magically is taken care of. Basically, this book was dull, boring, not as good as the first one, full of convenient plots and no explanation of anything.

  

--- 47. The Conspiracy of Us (The Conspiracy of Us, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-02-07

I don't entirely hate this book, but I'm not in love with it either. I think I'm more annoyed by this book. It's just... I can't even.... I don't know anymore. It starts off with Avery wanting to go to prom with hot guy #1 but can't because she has to move with her mom in two days. She sneaks out and goes anyways. There, hot guy #1 and hot guy #2 start fighting over her. (Seriously, this seems like some wishful thinking here) And Avery decides to leave with hot guy #2 who pulls a knife on her only a minute before. That's right, this girl who snuck out of the house decides to go with someone who threatened her life moments before and they happen to go out of the country. Because that's the most logical answer! Honestly, it would have been nice if Avery decided to go home or let her mom know or pack or something before just leaving. Or even thought about it more than, he's hot and mysterious. Whatever. She's in Paris. Which you can tell by the constant mentioning of the Eiffel Tower. Over and over again. How she can see it from her room. From the plane. From landing. From this, from that. I got it. Eiffel Tower is in Paris and saying that relates more to Pairs. But come on! You don't need to mention it over and over! Now there's some "mystery" going on and Avery wonders who this family is that she's suddenly related to now. Oh, turns out, it's the circle. And there's a prophecy, because what awesome book doesn't have a prophecy in it? And guess what? Avery happens to be in said prophecy with her stupid special eyes. Only a girl with purple eyes will something or another. And this family only has guys with purple eyes, but no girls. (Except the pregnant lady who is going to have twins and one is a girl with purple eyes. Is that even possible to know before they're born what color eyes they have?) And special special Mary Sue has to fit this prophecy and is the ONLY girl who has purple eyes!!! OMG!!! Ugh, fail already. Then there's all this history, which I'm up for. I love history. But it annoyed me about this history. Apparently these families are responsible for every major event in history including WWI and WWII. No. Just no. It didn't work. But the things that do need explaining are not explained. Like how do these families get in power and stay in power? No idea. Also, how in the world would some teenage girl know who the most famous golfer is and the French President is? Oh, yeah, and the VP of the US? I don't know that and I'm older than Avery is. But no, Avery knows everyone. Yay her... But Avery is so smart, yet she can't figure things out. She has no common sense at all. Things that should be obvious are not to her. Then, there's the forbidden romance! She's in love with hot guy #1 and he loves her, but it's so forbidden! If anyone finds out, he'll die! Blah, blah, blah. Find something new people. Can we have something original for a change? And love triangle. Just no. It's not surprising, but it's frustrating. Even more when both guys are described as hot guys and "mysterious". They're not. They're pathetic losers and one should be locked up. Then again, there's no real characterization. None of the characters are developed more than how hot they are. How "smart" they are. How rich they are. That's about it. I want to read more than he's so hot. That doesn't make me like a character. The "twists" in this book are so predictable. I knew what was going to happen before they mentioned it, it was disappointing when I was right. And it just ends. Nothing is solved or resolved. It ends because gotta do a trilogy! That's the new thing to make money. Seriously, half the boring crap could have been taken out, developed other things more and you could be done. The pacing was so bad too. If it was fixed, it would be better. I'm so frustrated with this book. It had potential but lost it. Thought about giving this two stars, but more I write here, more I'm annoyed and less motivated to give it two. One it is.

  

--- 48. Legacy (Legacy, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-01-29

Legacy by Cayla Kluver is the first in the Legacy trilogy. Seventeen year old Princess Alera of Hytanica is supposed to marry a man who will become king and her father's choice is not one she wants. What does catch her eye, though, is an intruder with steel-blue eyes and her kingdom's greatest enemy. The cover was pretty and it drew me in, which should have been a sign. Whenever there's a pretty cover, chances are, it's a horrible book. But, Cayla was only fifteen when she wrote this, so I figured, why not? But the thing is, I'm still wondering how this book was published. So, it starts out with a prologue, which pretty much tells everything you need to know about the book. In fact, you can read that and not have to read more because you know what's going to happen. A bunch of boys were taken from the enemy, all but one were returned dead. Guess where that one is? Yeah, if you guess he's with the enemy and suddenly comes back and is the intruder mentioned in the description, you guessed right. If you didn't guess that... there's something wrong with you, like missing common sense. Once you get past the prologue, you have to deal with the encyclopedia, I mean the story. Which consists of Alera telling the reader everything about everything. I don't mean explaining it or showing it, like you know, good writers do, but telling the story. TELLING it. Which makes it drag on even more. Honestly, it felt like I was reading an encyclopedia with random conversations in the middle. One of the big plot points for this story is just so ridiculously stupid that it would never ever happen. Once Alera turns eighteen, she has to marry and her husband will take over the kingdom as King right away and her father will step away. What kingdom EVER has EVER done that? What kingdom that you can think of has ever done that? NONE. Why? Because it's stupid and no King would ever be good enough because they wouldn't have any training whatsoever. It takes time to learn. If you just get some random guy off the street to be King once he's married, the kingdom is going to go downhill within a year or two. Add in the fact that Alera's kingdom is on the brink of war and you're really screwed. Why in the world would any king step down as soon as his daughter married when there's a war brewing? Does that make any sense whatsoever? In Cayla's world it does. So, the guy that Alera's dad chooses is this stuck up guy who Alera doesn't want to marry. And instead of actually saying anything to her father, she'd rather whine and complain about the fact that she has to spend time with him. By that, I mean whine and complain to the reader or her guard who can do nothing about it. And why is it that he's the ONLY guy in the kingdom that's eligible to marry? Is this kingdom so small and tiny that there's only a few people? Or so overpopulated with women, that there's not many guys there? WHY? Why is this creep the only one there? Then... there's the adverbs. The horrible, horrible adverbs. Adverbs are the tool of the lazy writer. Adverbs tell the story when you want to show your story. Cayla doesn't show a thing. All she does is tell us boring information after boring information. That's why this book is so thick - it's filled with boring encyclopedia information that no one cares about, like how a room is so splendidly decorated or what fine details are in someone's outfit. And adverbs. Tons of adverbs. I think there's one, if not more, in every sentence. Too many adverbs! After so much of this, I had to call it quits. I couldn't finish it. There is only so much encyclopedia reading, bad writing, horrible flat characters I can take before I want to knock someone out with the book. I honestly wanted to burn this book, but I got it from the library and I was not paying the fine for not returning it. I have always said it doesn't matter how old you are - be it sixteen or sixty - when you write and/or publish a book. I won't judge on that, I judge on the writing and the writing in this book was horrible. It's not even "good for fifteen". It's obvious Cayla doesn't know much about writing or what she's talking about. Maybe if this was a MG book or for younger audiences and Cayla had a different plot, or she waited until she knew more about writing to write this, it wouldn't have been so bad. But as it stands, it's horrible. I didn't finish and I'm not reading more of this series or from this author ever. I'm not recommending this book to anyone. Unless you want to fall asleep, that is.

  

--- 49. Sleep No More (Charlotte Westing Chronicles, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-01-24

Sleep no more follows the story of Charlotte, who happens to be an oracle. She learned early on that trying to change the visions she sees only create more problems. That alone should be a huge flag for Charlotte. She remembers what happened when she tried to fix a vision, and she still wants to keep doing that. Granted, I'm sure most would try to fix something as well, but when it didn't work before, and it made things worse, what would make you think it's going to be better? I enjoy Aprilynne's books. I have her Wings series, read her other books, but this was more of a disappointment for me. I will say I was reading it quickly and I didn't want to put it down. That doesn't mean it's good though. Charlotte was not all that interesting as a character. She seemed a bit slow on some things as well. Right from the beginning, there's a character that should send up a red flag that it's not a good thing, but she ignores it. I think she mentions she's not sure she should trust him, but she does. The evil guy was predictable and she even thinks that's who it is, but tries to convince herself otherwise. When you have to rationalize that someone can't be the killer, probably isn't a good thing. The romance was strange, at best. Linden started hanging out with her because his girlfriend died. And the romance was a way to get over his dead girlfriend. Yep, that happened. Sorry, but if you use me to get over a dead girlfriend, that's not awesome. That's not romance. But Charlotte is so deep in her crush on him, she doesn't care. And how in the world did the knife get explained away?! It was right there by the aunt's foot when the cops where called. Yet no one sees it? No one mentions it? Except when Linden is in the hospital and they joke about him tripping on a knife? Did no one see the aunt? Seriously? There were too many questions and plot holes. I think the concept was interesting, but the execution was horrible. The "bad guy" and ending is just thrown together randomly and it doesn't flow right. Nothing really flows right. I'm also surprised there's more to this book as well. I thought one was enough, not a series. Don't think I'll read more though. Disappointing.

  

--- 50. Illusions of Fate (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-01-24

Illusions of Fate follows the story of Jessamin, an outcast since she moved from her home in Melei to the dreary country of Albion. Here's the thing, there was no, or very little, world building. I have no idea anything else about these two countries or anything else going on in this book because there's no discussion. It got to the point where I just placed England instead of Albion (because it sounded just like it) and India/Jamaica/somewhere that England controlled in Victorian times, which is pretty much most of the world for Melei. Jessamin, as a character was eh at best. I mean, there were times I didn't mind her, but other times, she was annoying. She also goes back and forth about things. In fact, this book goes back and forth between the same thing. Jessamin grew up not learning the Melei language, but mostly the Albion language and says that she doesn't remember much of it. Or can't really express herself in that language. But earlier she says she loves talking to her cousin in Melei or if she hears Melei, it's nice to hear and talk with someone in that language as she doesn't do it often. Then, she can barely speak to another servant who only speaks Melei. What the what? Jessamin also goes into how she's Melei and needs to be proud of that or whatever. Then, she says how much of Albion she knows and was trained to be a lady and blah, blah, blah. Later on, she realizes she's not an Albion lady, she's Melei and all I had to say was "no kidding". Throughout the book, it's mentioned she's not Albion, she's Melei, but it takes this random thought to make her really realize she's Melei. The love interest was... blah. I mean, just blah. They just meet and what's his face hottie has his shadow attached to hers. Because he was worried for her. She tries to avoid him and refuses to fall for him, then she's all over him? It was eh. I will say there was that ending that was somewhat unexpected. Not entirely, but the way it was, I didn't expect it. I mean, I kinda figured the one character was involved somehow, but the way it ended was not what I thought. Then again, I didn't think that could have happened either. The characters weren't relatable at all. I didn't care for them. Jessamin is taken and hurt, and it doesn't matter to me. I'm just eh, moving on. I figured she would get out safely. I didn't expect any harm to come to her and didn't care. When you have no attachment to the characters, except maybe one that doesn't talk at all, that's sad. When you don't care if they're hurt or die, that's sad. That's not a good book at all. I wish this was more developed than it was. Disappointing more since Kiersten's other books weren't as bad. It read like a first book from an inexperienced author than the fifth or sixth (or however many it is now) one from an author. That alone should make it a one star, but I'm upping it to two stars for twist ending and, well, I still like Kiersten. Also, even though it was annoying, I did finish the book in a couple of hours. Though it was frustrating, I wanted to finish the book.

  

--- 51. Perfected (Perfected, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-01-13

Perfected follows the story of Ella, who is genetically engineered to be perfect and a slave. Don't ask how those things are related and go together. This book should have been awesome with its potential for questioning bigger things and so on. But it lacked so much. People are either born or bred (no mentioning of exactly how they start out) and genetically enhanced to be perfect. No, not people. Girls. Because what's more perfect than a hormonal teenage female? I think Kate forgot all about that stage in her life... There's no explanation about how or why this came about. It's lacking in substance and plot in that area. What made people decide to make humans pets? There's no reasoning. It's just expected, which is frustrating. Then there's the whole sex issues. Okay, these girls are beautiful beyond belief and NO ONE is taught about sex at all? And all these guys keep hitting on them and they don't get it? They just "don't like the way he touched me" or some crap like that. The characters lacked depth, lacked much of anything. The love wasn't really there until the end when they decide "I love you" for randomness. I didn't even see the love starting. For him, it seemed more of a rebel thing. And her, it seemed she's getting to know her feelings she has and he's the first boy her age. Give her another one and she'll be over the first guy. I will say I did read it quickly, just in a couple of hours, so I will give it the beach/lazy read. And if you don't think about the plot (or lack thereof) you could do fine. Apparently, there is some sort of "cliff hanger" to end the book making the reader wanting more, but I'm good. From the ending, it's a loose ending where you can draw your own conclusions about this book. I'm not reading more. Overall, 1.5 stars, but not motivated to give it 2 starts. :/ Disappointed.

  

--- 52. Firelight (Firelight, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-01-13

Meh, I'm still on the fence about this one. From the summary and looking at it, it sounds like a very good book. It's different than the normal vampires, angels, shifters, etc. Actually reading it? Completely different story. Firelight is about a girl who is a draki, a human who turns into dragon, a descendent of dragons. That alone was enough to pull me in. Dragons? Yes! Humans who turn into dragons? I'm sold! Jacinda lives with her twin sister, Tamra, and their mother. Tamra never showed any signs of her draki and therefore is a defective draki. Their mother willingly let her draki die because she didn't want to have it anymore. Their father was killed in a hunt. Jacinda is a rare draki as well. An extremely rare draki. A fire breathing one. One that hasn't been around in hundreds of years. (How cliched and Mary Sue of you) So, what do they expect Jacinda to do? Mate with the alpha male's son, Cassian, and have tons of draki babies with the hope of carrying on the fire breathing draki. However, Jacinda's mother takes her away so she's not going to be a baby making machine and Jacinda ends up meeting Will, a dragon hunter. Though they're enemies, they feel compelled to each other, drawn to each other though they have no idea why. And it turns out Will is the only one who makes her draki come out more so - meaning, she can get all hot and bothered around him. Literally. Even with all of that, and the fact that Will/Jacinda's relationship is just based on looks, lust, and wanting to be with each other without actually knowing each other, you'd think there would be something more. Something to make it stand out and actually interesting. But no. The relationship based on lust wasn't the worst of it. Every character in there was a flat character. Or bipolar. No freakin' lie. Jacinda was an annoying selfish girl who wondered why her harsh mother wouldn't give her freedom when her mother was trying to protect her. She was always "me, me, me, me". Jacinda wants to go back to the draki pride where they wanted her to have tons of babies. Yet, she doesn't approve of that. Jacinda, you either don't approve of something and don't want to go back or you deal with it and go back. You can't have it both ways. Be there and do whatever you want even though going back means you can't. After a while, Jacinda just got annoying and dislikable. Their mother, just as bad. She's claiming she's doing all these things for their protection, yet she wants her daughter to kill a part of herself that she claims she can't be without. All of them were so wishy-washy, it wasn't even funny. Changing their minds so many times and none of it matched what they said a page before. Jacinda was also just so disrespectful to her mother as well. Just so rude. If I had ever acted like that to my mother, I would have gotten smacked. And then Jacinda wonders why her mother treats her like a child. Maybe it's because you act like one hon. Stop acting like that and maybe you'll be treated differently. One thing I was confused about, and I'm not sure if it's I didn't read it right or it just wasn't explained as well, I have no idea what these drakis look like. I get that they're dragons, but I don't know how big. Are they the normal size of dragons? Or are they a little bit bigger than human size? I have no idea. If that was explained, I missed it. If it wasn't, I wish it was. Basically, it was really just a stereotypical cliched book with standard guy who isn't supposed to be with the girl and they end up falling in love because they're hot, parents who just don't care/understand, and stalkers. Apparently, that's the rage for all books out there since Twilight came out. Which this book seems like a dragon version of it, only in heat instead of cold. And instead of the guy being the one that should be avoided because they're different, it's the girl. Chances are, I'll recommend this book but I won't buy it. I got it from the library and I don't think I'm that crazy enough about it to buy the book. However, I will read the next book because the way it left off, you'll have to read the next book to answer the questions and understand what's going on. Honestly, like a 2-3 star rating.

  

--- 53. Inside Out (Insider, #1) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2015-01-13

POSSIBLE SPOILERS Inside Out by Maria V. Snyder follows the story of Trella, who's a scrub. Basically, she, and thousands like her, do the dirty work and keep things going for the Uppers. While Trella is more into hiding and being by herself, she somehow gets herself into a revolution and even leading the rebellion. I bought this book over a year ago because it sounded interesting and it was more of a dystopian novel, which I'm liking. Out of all the Maria books I've read, I think this was a lot better than most, but I'm still not sure I like it entirely. -The characters themselves were not all that interesting. They were either flat or boring or just weak. Trella wasn't bad, but she wasn't strong enough. Positive side: at least she wasn't a Mary Sue like Maria has a tendency to do... -The world building, well, sucked. I get that Maria wanted a bit of mystery going on and she didn't want to spoil things out right away, but it got to the point where I didn't even know what was going on or where everything was. I needed a map or diagram. And she didn't even have to spoil the ending, though that's predictable, just have enough of where Trella is going so we're not clueless. Maybe there's a map in the second book though. -The "big spoiler" is really not that hard to figure out. There is a small amount of mystery, but after a while, it's pretty easy to figure out what's going on and where they are. I wasn't even that shocked when they had the big announcement. -Million weeks. That's a big thing going on for the scrubs. Something is supposed to happen week one million. But where they're at now, there's no way it's going to happen in ANY of the lifetimes of the characters. It kinda sucks when it's that far away and that unrealistic. -It's supposed to be "intriguing" and suspenseful, but to me, it was just boring. It seemed to drag on for a while. Some of it wasn't too bad and it wasn't boring, but for the most part, it dragged on forever. Maria's Study series, even though they were horrible cliched messes, at least had something to keep you reading. This didn't have much going for it. -It is very clean. No profanity or sex. Which is a good thing. There are a lot of books out there with cussing and sex or references to sex, so it's nice to read a book without all of that every once in a while. -While it wasn't the best book, it was better than Maria's other books. It wasn't the same plot she tends to stick to. If you like dystopian novels or sci fi novels, then you're probably like this one. If you enjoy Maria's books, you'll probably enjoy this one. If you want something quick to read, go ahead and give it a go. I'm not entirely crazy about it, but I'll probably just read the next book anyways, just to see what happens and how it ends. Overall, between two and three stars.

  

--- 54. Bitterblue (Graceling Realm, #3) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-01-13

Like most people, I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I enjoyed Gracling and Fire by Kristin Cashore and was excited to find out about Bitterblue coming out. However, I'm not sure Bitterblue is written by the same author. Maybe it's been a while since I've read Fire and Graceling. Maybe it's been a while for Kristin since she's written a book. Maybe I've grown as a reader/writer/editor since reading the first two books and anything wrong with the first two, I didn't notice them. Whatever it was, Bitterblue just wasn't as good as it could have been. It started with Bitterblue being bored of her Queenly duties. It continues the same way for a while. If Bitterblue is so bored of her Queenly duties, what makes Kristin think we'll be so excited to read them? After a while, Bitterblue decides she's going to risk everything and sneak out at night and explore her city. Never mind that she could put herself and the Kingdom at stake. She's bored and wants to have some fun. I get that she's bored and wants to see things, but come on. It is a bit risky to do what she does every night. She's a Queen for crying out loud. I get that some of the characters were mentally unstable and all, but I think there came a point where it was just too much reading all of it. Or maybe it was because Bitterblue kept pushing and wondered why she was getting no where. Bitterblue, here's a hint, when something tragic happens to someone, sometimes, they don't want to talk about it. You keep pressuring them is not going to make them talk even more. I think all of that annoyed me further. I did enjoy the Prologue - though I'm not a fan of those anymore - because I liked the "mind rape" that we read through Bitterblue. I liked the fact that there was more than meets the eye in this book, there were twists and turns and a "smart" plot in here. I liked the fact that it did tie in Graceling and Fire in here. Fire was more towards the end and in a way that wasn't expected. Of course, it has been a while since I read Fire so I don't remember what happened or what was going on with all the characters... I was a bit disappointed with the way some things ended up the way they did. Maybe that's leading for another book, or maybe Kristin just wanted to end things the way she did. I wasn't crazy about the Saf/Bitterblue ending. Basically, this book was rather long and it dragged on. It's not like Fire or Graceling where it didn't seem like they were long. This showed and you felt it was long as you try to read through the entire thing. It's not easy. I think Bitterblue was partly to blame for that. She wasn't bad sometimes, but for the most part, she wasn't that interesting of a character. I'm torn between wanting another book and wanting this to end where it was. I'm thinking if Kristin can make an amazing book to tie up everything, then I wouldn't mind another book with the same characters. But, how about in Katsa's POV instead of Bitterblue? Or maybe just years from now with new characters? That works.

  

--- 55. Uninvited (Uninvited, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2015-01-06

Uninvited follows the story of a pampered princess who finds out she has the gene that will turn her into a murderer. The thing is, I don't think it really dives into the whole HTS thing and explained it all that well. Which is sad considering this is what the plot focuses on. It's one of those, on the surface, it looks good, but if you really think about it, it's not there. Davy as a character was really annoying. She was perfect because she was perfect. The whole book over and over mentioned how she was so gifted at everything, she could play any instrument she wanted to as soon as she touched them and she was perfect at them! She had an amazing voice! And so on. It was old. How can you relate to your character when all you hear is how perfect they are? That wouldn't be as bad as it was had it not been for the fact that she is selected to be in a special program because of her musical skills and talents. A program where they school kids with HTS on killing. Because the next murderer is going to kill you with her beautiful piano recital and singing voice. The more the story goes on, the more holes it starts to have and more plausibility of the whole thing goes out the window. There's that insta-love guy helping out because she's hot, I guess, or something. Who knows really. I think she likes him cause he's hot. For some strange reason, I do want to read more of this. But I know it's not good and the more I think about it and reflect it, it's just horribly done. It's one of those horrible accidents that you know you shouldn't stop to look at, but you can't help it. Or that candy you know is bad for you, but you ignore that warning and eat it anyways. If you can just ignore the plot(among other things), it might be worth reading. But if you honestly want your plot to have meaning and understanding, this is so not the book for you.

  

--- 56. Defy (Defy, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2014-04-06

Defy by Sara B Larson is the story of Alexa who has to hide herself as a boy and serve the King's army and a guard for the Prince. A sorcerer comes in the dead of night who Alexa can't stop and now she, the Prince, and her friend Rylan are heading into enemy territory, all with their own secrets. I wanted to like this book, I really really did. I mean, I knew right from the description it was probably a Mary Sue and it was going to be a love triangle. But it gave the premise of being a Mulan sort of book. I love Mulan. Love it! So, I decided that the author would make it work and things would be okay. I was so so wrong. So horribly wrong. For the first part, it was about swords and fighting, which was cool. But little miss Alexa was so much better than everyone else. Got annoying, but was going to deal with it. But then, it would be thrown in there, Alexa had to hide who she was because she would have to go to rape houses. Okay... rape houses... And the whole "rape houses" aren't mentioned all throughout the book. It's only when Alexa wants to point out why she had to be a boy and what she was avoiding. I highly doubt any King would have a rape house so all women could keep breeding children for this war he wants to keep going. Honestly, if he was that desperate, he would give swords to the women and children and say "fight" and that would be that. It honestly just got worse from there. Instead of pretending like a man - like she was supposed to do - she ends up staring at "chocolate eyes" of her friends and the hotness of them. I wouldn't have been surprised if she was drooling at those times. At which case, I would think something is a bit odd with that guy... (At least, I'm assuming that's what the other guard members thought?) Speaking of "chocolate eyes", that was what half the book was filled with. -_- Man, that was annoying. It didn't even seem hot either. The way it was described was like melted chocolate, which I kept thinking of poo and I'm sure that's not what the author wanted. Anyways, it was annoying and got old. Then of course, it seems like she doesn't even need to hide that she's a girl because EVERYONE KNOWS SHE'S A GIRL. She's surprised that they do, but when she does all the blushing, staring, and crying and what not, can you blame them? Once that is out of the way, she really starts acting like a girl. The rest of the book is just her staring at the two boys longingly and crying. Ugh, it was so annoying. So frustrating. And the boys... the boys... Damian was a jerk. Plain and simple, he was a jerk. He kept things hidden and a secret but he wanted Alexa to trust him. How could she when she didn't know what was going on? Of course Alexa was mentioning how much of a bipolar attitude he had but she thought because he's with her, he's better. I couldn't stand the back and forth from him. Rylan was okay, but then he got all weak and puppy eyed and was like, I'll still love you no matter what. That just ruined his character so much. Be the man! As soon as Damian kisses Alexa though, she's about ready to have sex with him. That must have been one powerful kiss there. The world building sucked. I mean sucked! I have no idea what to imagine because there was nothing described except something along the lines of tropical and heat. Yeah, that helps. (How did Sara get this sold again?) It's just full of wishy-washy characters, a freaking Mary Sue who has to discover her special powers as the story goes on, huge plot holes-who in the world are they fighting and how are they keeping up with the army when it takes years before someone in a rape house to be able to fight-and just dull boring crap. If you think it's Mulan, it's not. It's a romance, crybaby book in disguise of an action book.

  

--- 57. Panic (Panic, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2014-04-06

Panic by Lauren Oliver follows the story of Heather and Dodge in Carp. Not much happens in this small town except the game of Panic. Graduating seniors compete in this game for a chance to win money. I... I can't. I can't even write a decent summary of this book without going "WTF?" I've read all of Lauren Oliver's books and it seems like each one I'm cringing more and more. It's a steady decline, which is sad. I hoped that this would be something different and better for me, but it seems like I'm wrong. First off, who decided that being so bored means putting your life at risk? Then decided, let's do this over and over again during the summer to have fun? Then said, let's have all the seniors do this to have fun! Oh, yeah, let's make it more interesting by making everyone put money towards this thing and the "winner" of being the most stupid bravest out of all of us will get all the money! And hey, if someone doesn't want to pay because they realize this is just stupid, we'll beat them up! Yeah, sounds awesome! I understand it being boring in town and you want to do something. I understand you want to have fun and do something challenging. Or even put a little fear in your life. I get that. What I don't get is making others do the same thing, making them pay for someone doing all of this, and having some sick contest on who can stand the longest. Some of the challenges didn't seem that fear inducing either. Jump off a cliff. Okay...? There are plenty of people who do that. But whatever. Another challenge is to go into a drunkard's house, who is known to have several guns and will shot at someone, and steal something from his house. So, basically they're saying, risk being shot by some guy and get arrested for trespassing and stealing, but you'd so totally move on in the game and a chance to win money. Sorry, but no amount of money is worth being shot at, no offence. The challenges go on and increase on various degrees of stupidity, I mean bravery. But it just gets so boring, I don't care anymore. I don't care about the characters. In fact, two characters are trapped in a burning building and it sorta gives the vibe that they're going to die in there, and I'm like, whatever. I don't care. It doesn't even matter to me if they did die, except that would end the book sooner, which would have been awesome. But a good writer would make you feel about the characters and not want any harm, including death, to happen to them. It's just getting worse as the book goes along and the whole time I'm wondering when I'll be done because it's boring, flat, and uninteresting. I just don't care anymore. I end up skimming about 60% of the way through, just to find out what happens and guess what, it's predictable. Who I thought would win, did. It was almost as exciting as it was listing to Heather complain over and over her boyfriend dumped her and therefore she had to enter the Panic games-stupidest reason ever. Simple point: stupid book, not worth the time for anyone.

  

--- 58. Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2012-10-15

POSSIBLE SPOILERS Throne of Glass by Sarah J Maas follows the story of eighteen year old Calaena Sardothien, an assassin who spent the past year in the salt mines, who is offered a chance at freedom. The catch? She has to act as a champion in a competition to work as a royal assassin for the King whom she hates. To make matters worse, contestants start turning up dead and it's not just a race to win, but to survive. When I heard about this, I was interested. The MC an assassin? Yeah! The awesome cover as well? Bonus! The fact that it's supposed to be Game of Thrones and Hunger Games mix or a Game of Thrones for young adults? Pretty awesome! Okay, I wasn't crazy about Game of Thrones, but I thought that maybe if this was like it but more for young adults, I might enjoy it more. Yeah, no. Not happening. It starts out with Calaena recruited by the crown Prince, Dorian, who offers her freedom. While she's not happy about who she's gonna work for, she takes it because it means freedom. After all, anyone who goes to the salt mines don't last but a few months and if they try to escape, they die within five steps. Well, except for Calaena because she's strong and awesome. Whatever. Since Calaena has been in the salt mines for a year, she needs training and who better to do that than Captain of the Guards, Captain Chaol Westfall. At first, Calaena is horrible at her training and she pukes every day because she runs right after eating. Yeah, I'm not really feeling sorry for her there because she runs right after eating which is stupid. Blah, blah, blah, skip a bit and the tests start happening for the contestants. Calaena is supposed to "stay in the middle" of things so she doesn't seem all that awesome, but she's not last either. Meanwhile, some of the contestants are turning up dead and it's usually around a test. So, Calaena decides she's going to try to figure things out. A few murders later and it seems she knows or suspects more than the Captain of the Guards who has been looking into these murders since they happened. Wow, if only Calaena had gotten to them sooner, it would have solved the mystery in the first place! *rolls eyes* Now, when I read the summary, I assumed that this book would be filled with more adventures and tests and all kinds of awesomeness. Sadly, I was mistaken. I think only one or two of the tests that last over a period of months (MONTHS, mind you) is really explained. All the others are just "we had a test yesterday" or brushed over just as bad. The only one more than a line was mentioning how it was some archery or sword fighting or whatever and she passed it. So what is this book filled with? Dresses. Okay, so there's more than that, but that's what it seemed like. Instead of reading action or tests or anything of the sort that we were promised (according to the summary), we read how pretty Calaena is, how detailed the dresses are, how pretty Calaena is, how handsome Prince Dorian and Captain Chaol are, how pretty Calaena is, how skilled at everything Calaena is, etc. It's awesome that Calaena is a strong, snarky woman, but come on. Instead of making a strong character, like I'm sure Sarah wanted to do, she ends up making a Mary Sue who is annoying. All we read is how pretty that girl is or how much she talks to the handsome boys or something the like instead of actually reading how awesome an assassin she is. I still don't believe she's an assassin. Didn't prove it to me at all. Not only that, but there's no depth to her or much of the other characters. Hey, Sarah, when you want your readers to actually feel for or feel connected to your characters, you need to build (and show) the character's backstory. Which means, explain why the character is the way they are. It doesn't have to be an info dump, but it does mean explaining something. Did we get this for Calaena? Nope. Each time we got close to something, it's brushed aside or Calaena doesn't want to talk about it. I understand that she's an assassin and she keeps things to herself, but we do need to know something. Even later on, in the finale battle between her and Cain, Cain mentions her parents and it's something important, something to grab onto as readers, and nothing happens. It's brushed aside or Calaena explains what she wants to about it, which isn't much. Because of the lack of backstory, I feel nothing for any of the characters. Calaena is so beaten up, but it doesn't matter. I don't care. I wouldn't care if she died because I feel nothing for her. No backstory, no reason to make her real, nothing to ground her, nothing to make her human. You'd think that if Sarah wrote this story years ago and has been working on it since, she would have developed a better back story for her characters, but no. It's like it escaped her that she actually needs to build her characters up. Not only where her characters lacking building, but the world building was lacking as well. There was a little bit of world building, but it was like a line layer of it and not enough, not deep enough. Not to mention, the writing was so juvenile! The dialogue was good, yes, but that's about it. The dialogue was only decent because Calaena had to look awesome, or sound awesome. There were times that the wording was so horrible, it seemed like someone who doesn't know English as a first language wrote it. It was awkward to read. And, to top it all off, there's a love triangle. With the beautiful "look at me" Calaena and the handsome-every-girl-wants Prince, and the handsome, amazingly-talented-at-a-young-age Captain of the Guard. Because every YA book needs a love triangle. *rolls eyes* Okay, I know everyone has to have a love triangle in their story, but come on! Enough already!! I'm sick of reading love triangles. I hated them to begin with and they're getting old. So, so old. And all we find out about these fools is that they're handsome. That's only after beautiful Calaena decides she doesn't hate them as much. The plot wasn't as interesting as it appeared to be and I wasn't in a rush to read through it as quick as I thought I would be. I wouldn't even be surprised if Sarah is making this into a trilogy, because what YA book wouldn't be complete without a love triangle and a trilogy? And then there was this random magic plot thrown in that didn't seem to mesh as well with it. To me, it felt like the plot was written and Sarah thought she needed something different so she added this other magic-type plot in there as well. Something about markings and whatever. It was odd to say the least. Throne of Glass is not what it's made out to be. It's not as exciting as it's appeared to be. It's rather dull and filled with fluff than action/assassining. If it was a trilogy, I *might* read the next one, but I'm not going to rush out and buy it, nor am I buying this book. Not really recommending this book to anyone either.

Fire Study by Maria Snyder is the third story in the study series, following Yelena as she and her friends are trying to capture Cahil and Ferde. However, it turns out there's a bigger problem when they find out a clan of magicians are using Blood magic to try to take over the Citadel. Honestly, I have no idea what this book is about. It's all a jumbled mess full of crap. It's just... so not worth reading it. I read reviews saying it wasn't as good but since I already had it from the library I figured I'd read it. Maybe I shouldn't have though... What's funny and ironic to me is that in the beginning, Maria has a note thanking a few people and mentioning how she went to glass blowing class and what not. In that note, she thanks her husband for helping her not have any plot holes. Yet, the entire series is filled with plot holes. This book is a prime example of plot holes. Maria, I don't think your husband did all that good of a job. The writing was so stiff, choppy and dull. I'm not talking about just choppy, short sentences either. Though it was filled with that. I'm also talking about the writing itself. It was as if there was supposed to be more, but Maria just deleted pages of it, expecting people not to notice. None of it made any sense. It makes for a bad, awkward read. But to the summary/review: So, Yelena and her friends manage to find Cahil and Ferde and while fighting them, Yelena enters Ferde's mind and pretty much makes him brain dead because of what he did. When they all go back to the Citadel, Cahil turns it all on Yelena and Marrok, saying Cahil was undercover and Marrok was the one who freed Ferde and what not. Of course, since Yelena destroyed Ferde's brain, now the council have even more reason to fear her. And Roze, first Magician, backs Cahil up saying it was a secret mission. Which really should be a big flag right there, but whatever. Next thing you know, Yelena and Leif are being accused of trying to start a war with Sitia and an execution is sent out for them. The reason she knows this is because Yelena uses her awesome Mary Sue powers and enters Irys's mind and discovers all of this. So, after that, they head to Ixia. Because clearly, that's the only place no one would think to look for them. After that point, it seems everything goes screwy. I don't mean just the plans. I mean the characters, the plot, the, well, everything. Yelena seems like a wishy-washy character who doesn't know what she wants and depending on where she is and who she's with depends on how she acts. When they arrive in Sitia, Leif asks about Yelena staying with the Commander. She mentions it was for two years there. Yet, the first book was (supposedly) just a year. So... where was this other year coming from? I'm still not sure how each book was a year long because it doesn't seem like it. Maybe a few months, that's it. But nothing about being a full year. Anyways, this is also the time when Yelena discovers where the Commander is staying is so very similar to the Citadel. Strange it took her THREE BOOKS to discover that. Yelena mentions in the first book about how she's no fool. However, that statement seems to be the opposite of how she is now. She's so stupid and even admits how stupid she is. Moon Man gives her cryptic advice and she doesn't get it and even says she's so stupid and doesn't get anything. What happened to the "not a fool" part? Why does Moon Man insist on giving Yelena cryptic advice to begin with? She clearly doesn't get anything, so why do it? It's a waste of time and makes no sense. It's a bad plot point and pointless because it's done to "keep things hidden" when really, it's just wasting time and ends up making the MC look stupid for not knowing a simple answer. Or that no one knew the real answer to begin with. Next time, just tell her exactly what she needs to know. Maybe she'll get the hint. Several times Yelena mentions how they have rabbit stew for dinner and that it's ready within a short amount of time. Unless someone has some stew making magic, that doesn't happen. It takes a LONG time to make stew. And when you're on the run, stew is not the best option because it takes too long and is basically an all day event. One of the "do not do in a fantasy" list is to know that it does take a long time to make a stew and that having it made while on the run is not the best idea. Why does Leif seem to suddenly not know what his magic is? Didn't he used to be able to read/smell people? Why is that suddenly gone? So many times that could have been a big help, but was never used. They forgot about it? Why is Valek acting like a sad, lost little puppy instead of the assassin he used to be? Granted, at times he did act more like the assassin, but most of the time he was all... weird. So out of character. So different from the first book. Then he was harsher, now he's all mellow and soft. It's like the complete opposite. He's also supposed to be this great stagiest yet Yelena is the only one who can come up with these brilliant idea, which end up sucking and fail epically. There was no depth to the characters. There was a small amount in the first book, but now there's none at all. They're flat, dull, boring characters. And Yelena is riding that Mary Sue train like there is no tomorrow and Valek is right behind her in the Gary Stu train. Not just in this book, but others as well, there was so many times where it was supposed to be "scary" because they were in so much "trouble" but really, you know it's not bad. Somehow, Yelena uses her Mary Sue powers and ends up saving the day once again. I never thought or felt like Yelena or anyone was in some sort of danger because it would be the same thing - fight, capture, can't move, Yelena finds some new odd way to escape, using her Mary Sue powers, captured again, Mary Sue again, etc. None of the antagonists were developed well enough. I think that's because Maria tried to put too much into her story, making it a jumbled mess. If it was just one person or a couple people, it would have been fine. But there were too many people and too many twists or whatever and made it horrible. It's too much, too cluttered, and none of it matters. It's like, if Maria had taken out about half of the clutter, it would have been a lot better, made more sense, and been smoother. Yet, she wanted so much crammed into the story, it was too much. Roze... that was just sad and obvious with a big fat DUH. Because she doesn't like Yelena, clearly she's evil. Since she's so set about killing Yelena, she's going to be evil. Since she's so powerful, she won't be noticed as being evil even though she is. It's so obvious, so cliched, so annoying. And why is it that if someone doesn't like Yelena, they're evil. Or they're jealous? Why can't someone who is good NOT like Yelena? Also, since Leif was with Roze for that long, why is it he never noticed Roze was evil? Why did he not sense/smell/whatever it's called Roze and her true feelings? Why is it such a shock to him that Roze is evil? Why is it no one knows Roze's real name? She goes her whole life as one name and suddenly, once she's a magician, she's a different name? Why didn't anyone say anything about that? Why did she change her name? When did she? Way back when she started? If so, why did no one say anything? If it was more recent, why didn't anyone question it? There's just no point in anything, no reason behind anything, no explanation though they seem to have already done things, no anything. It's just horrible. The first books might not have been all that good, but they did have some redeeming quality in it. But this didn't have anything. It wasn't even all that exciting or pulled you in as much as the second one did. Honestly, I don't think it's that good at all. There are too many flaws, too many plot holes, too many horrible things going on and nothing good. Maria took a story and made it bad to worse. Just don't read it.

When I started reading this book, I tried to keep thinking positive. After all, it's not every day that a self published author turns a millionare from her books, right? But as I read on, I realized there's a reason she's a self published author and why I'm not a fan of self published authors. After a few pages into the book, Wendy finds out she's a troll. I don't know about you, but when I picture trolls, I picture gruesome creatures, nasty, ugly, etc. That's how they've always been. But not Amanda. No, she wants beautiful trolls that have magic. And when Wendy meets the Queen troll, she sees the most beautiful woman she has ever seen and it turns out, Wendy is the daughter of pretty lady! Wow, didn't see that coming whatsoever. I understand taking something and making it your own. I agree with that. Go right ahead. But there's a line where you shouldn't mess with certain things anymore. Example is the beautiful trolls with magic. As far as I know, trolls don't have magic. (Everything I have researched in the past years, says no magic.) Yet, Amanda's trolls have magic. And they're beautiful. These would be the first and only beautiful trolls. Honestly, they sounded more like faeries than trolls to me. There wasn't any characteristics that said "troll". Finn, the guy from school who stares at Wendy all the time, turns out to be another troll there to help Wendy and take her back home. He's a tracker, and it turns out it's forbidden for Wendy and Finn to be together. (big shocker there) And what we see about Finn is that he stares at Wendy. A LOT. And then he appears at her bedroom window, watching her. That's not creepy at all. Of course, Wendy admits that this is creepy and he's a stalker, but then, a few pages later on, she says how attractive he is and how much she cares about him. CARES ABOUT HIM. The guy who stalks her. But it's okay because he's hot. What is it with these YA books saying it's okay or perfectly normal for a girl to fall in love with a guy even though he stalks her because he's hot? I guess it doesn't matter that the guy could be a murderer or rapist, as long as he's hot, it's all good. There's no surprise that Finn and Wendy love each other. I'm still wondering how or why. All she said was he stalks her or he was hot. I guess that's love for her. And him, all he did was give her the "I'm constipated" look and be grumpy and suddenly he's so in love he can't be around her or he'll put her at risk and it'll ruin her chances of becoming Queen and blah blah blah crap. Ooh, drinking game! Take a shot every time there's an adverb in the book. I think you'll be drunk after the first page though. :\ I'm serious, there's THAT many adverbs. I believe at one point there was one per sentence, at least. Amanda, FYI, adverbs are the tool of the lazy writer. Adverbs tell. You want to SHOW your story. You showed NOTHING. And the descriptions Amanda uses... was she high when she wrote some of them? They just don't make sense at all. This book is also cliched as I don't know what with a Mary Sue falling in love with a Gary Stu. -_- The changeling, the fact that she's a Princess, the fact she doesn't want to be a Princess, the fact that she's in love with someone that she can't be with, etc. It would actually be nice to read a book that isn't cliched or filled with Mary Sues for once. Is that too much to ask for? Wendy has got to be the stupidest MC there is, or top on the list. After a while, I just wanted to throw this book at her head because she doesn't get it. Any of it. It's clear as day and the readers get it, but she's too stupid to get it. Overall, it sucked. I liked the fact that it was trolls, but that was ruined by not really being trolls too much. It was cliched and filled with Mary Sues and adverbs-all of which I can't stand. It's too predictable. It got to the point where I didn't even really read it-I just skimmed it and hoped it was all over soon. Like a bad accident you can't avoid, it comes at you and there's no where to hide. But no matter where you go, it's horrible.
