--- 1. The Whitechapel Fiend (Tales from the Shadowhunter Academy, #3) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2017-07-09

Oh, great, another Herondale story, ANOTHER Will story. I hate him, and I really couldn't care less about Tessa either. She's useless and spineless and contributes nothing to the plot. Oh, look, my favourite trope: Only nerds and jocks exist, and they are mutually exclusive. Nerdy people can't possibly interested in sports. Because this is (AMERICAN) High School or something. Someone, please tell Clare that the real world doesn't work this way and that the rest of the world usually doesn't follow American conventions either. I wonder why she evens bothers to pretend these stories are about Simon. They really aren't[[IE1]](#_msocom_1) .

Rated 1/5 on 2017-06-27

Barely tolerable, not worthy of the "Elder Scrolls" title. Making an useless Breton woman whose only skills is in "the kitchen" the protagonist? Please! This is not the 50s anymore. No, seriously, I've read better fanfiction with complex and amazing female characters at ff.net and ao3.org. Save your money and a tree today! Go read fanfiction!

Can someone explain to me why people think Tamlin's "change" in the second book was OOC? After all, he basically blames Feyre for almost getting raped in this book. Tamlin is not a "hunk", he's a fuckboy, whose only redeeming quality seem to be how "pretty yet masculine" he is. This is bullshit. And of course, the implication that he doesn't mind having sex while he isn't really himself because "he's a dude, they're always up for it!" is unbelievable gross. Also, can someone explain to me why so many people love Rhys when he spent most of his time in this book sexually assaulting Feyre? No, I don't give a fuck that he felt "sorry" about it. I don't get it. I don't really want to get it. No, really: http://readingwithavengeance.com/tagg.... This is a nice chapter-by-chapter review that highlights most of the issues I have with this book, I highly recommend it. The only "good" thing I can say about this book and the sequel, is that at least doesn't use the "Love can change him!" bullshit trope when it comes to Tamlin (the less I say about Rhysand the better). Tamlin was a fuckboy in this book, and he's still a fuckboy during ACOMAF.

Some reviewers have said that this book is like crack, and I agree with them. Do you know what crack does to your body? Let's just say that is actually very, very bad for your health (http://science.howstuffworks.com/crac...), specially for your cognitive functions. Don't even bother with this book, unless you are a teenager that still thinks that "Rape is love", "He hurts you because he loves you"; or an adult that still has the mind of a teenager, I guess.

--- 5. Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass, #3) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2017-03-10

"I want a guy like Rowan..." I wonder if these people hear themselves. Do you want a guy that punches you ("but now he's Celaena's equal!") in the face because he feels like it and it's a total piece of shit? I don't care if he's "dark and mysterious", he's an asshole and I have no time for his whining, oh sorry, his "banter". Knowing that he ends up with Celaena is just the icing on the shit cake. I'm too old for these abusive romances that are passed as "love". And don't get me started with that happens to that spy girl (I can't even remember her name! ), who is only there to suffer prettily, like a good woman of colour I guess? ("she's so sweet and shy and spineless-I mean kind, yeah she's kind") and die so Dorian can get character development. Maas, you're fucking racist. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because I enjoyed the fighting scenes and the way Maas described magic. That's it.

--- 6. Saving Raphael Santiago (The Bane Chronicles, #6) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2017-03-07

What a disappointment. This short story wasn't really about Magnus, but about Jace 3.0 (5.0? I've lost count), I mean "Raphael". It seems CC is only capable of writing the same type of male character. Raphael is not only rude and unnecessarily abrasive, but so goddamn "perfect" that I can't even sympathize with him, no matter how hard I try: He's 15 but a "natural leader"! He intimidates vampires centuries older than him! He's wiser and a better leader than Camillie even though he is, again, a fifteen year old kid. Isn't he so amazing and perfect? No, he's not; he makes me want to barf to be honest. Not even Jacewill (yes, both of them; they are the same character after all) was this badly written or obnoxious. Oh, he's also a racist caricature of a latino, but I guess I should've expected that, since Clare has proven over and over again that she's a racist that can't write latino characters with actual depth.

--- 7. The Lost Herondale (Tales from the Shadowhunter Academy, #2) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2017-03-06

Oh, no, please god, no more brooding useless Herondales! For the love of God, no! The world doesn't need more of these wastes of space. I know Kit is the missing Herondale since I read Lady Midnight before this one. At this point, Cassandra should just name her series "The Herondale show", since everything seems to revolve around them and their "precious" bloodline. At least this story was about Simon, and the Herondales don't appear much. And once again, Cassandra Clare proves why the Shadowhunters work better as the villains, with their draconian laws and their treatment of their own people. These assholes actually believe the worst crime someone can commit is being a coward (but it's fine! because Tobias was tricked, you see, he wasn't really a dirty coward!). They're ableist, racist and homophobic, and we're supposed to be sympathetic toward them? I wish we could get a book about Catarina since she's twice as interesting as the Shadowhunters (not like that it's difficult); of course, Cassandra would probably ruin her character.

--- 8. Lady Midnight (The Dark Artifices, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2017-03-05

Sometimes I wonder, why I do this to myself? Why did I read the entire TMI series AND TID series? Maybe I am a masochist? Or maybe... maybe I like to watch trainwrecks, and reading this series, certainly qualifies as watching one. To be honest, while Clare's worldbuilding is derivate at best, I do think it has a lot untapped potential. Starting with the fact that the shadowhunters work best as the bad guys, as the "angelic warriors" who look down on both humans and supernatural creatures, who abuse their powers and must be taken down. But, of course, Clare loves too much her self-inserts to actually give them flaws that have consequences, instead, these are just mentioned in passing or retconned. There are a couple of things I learned about Cassandra Clare with this book: a) She loves to include romance in all of her books but is actually incapable of writing romance Full disclosure: I'm a sucker for romance, yet I loathe the romance genre, especially the straight kind, either in books or movies. There's just so many tropes I can put up with, too much "timid, sweet, submissive women and the alpha males that love rape them" bullshit I can read before wanting to vomit. I hate books that are dedicated entirely to romance; I prefer when the romance develops organically amidst the plot and action. I have no patience for the silly, puerile notion or "first and ONLY love" or "soulmates", or whatever fancy word the YA and Romance genres like to use. I like romances that are based on friendship, about two people who DON'T NEED each other to live, who have their own needs and goals in life, but who still want to be together because they care about each other. Clare tries to sell her books as "adventure with a dash of romance" but they are nothing of the sort; they are pure fluff. Clare cares more about how "pretty" her characters are than developing their emotions and psychology. She writes paragraphs and paragraphs about how her male characters have chiseled features and long eyelashes that cast shadows on their cheekbones... Her books are about badly written puerile romance. I'm not asking for an adult romance, after all, Emma and the other characters are teenagers (hormonal, over-emotional, dumb teenagers), all I'm asking is for a romance that has actual development. Mark and Christina? Just kind of there, no development at all. Mark and Kieran? Creepy and abusive, but hey, representation! (No) Julian and Emma? Creepy and melodramatic. I couldn't care less about them and their supposed bond, nor about Julian emotional constipation. b) She doesn't know how to pace her narrative or how to plot God, there's so much padding in this book; there are entire chapters where nothing happens, the characters just sit around and banter, but nothing changes. One would think Clare would use those chapters to develop her characters and their relationships, but she doesn't. There are so many scenes that serve no purpose other than up the angst, and that even read the same, to the point I had to go back a couple of pages and make sure I wasn't re-reading a page or two. There are also too many descriptions that serve no purpose other than padding: I don't care how many shades of gold Emma's hair is, nor how the sun reflects on Julia's glass bracelet. I DON'T CARE. But my favourite part has to be when she describes a character making "cartoon hearts eyes". This isn't anime, for fuck's sake. c) She wants to write "representation" but it comes as clumsy or just plain offensive Look, I'm not autistic myself and have really not enough experience to address the elephant in the room but I can still tell that Ty's characterization is all over the place. It's like Cassandra just read a bullet point list on "How Autistic People Act" and went with it. But honestly, as a Mexican woman, I'm more interested in talking about Christina and Diego. It's obvious that Clare has no fucking idea of what she's doing. Not only she made her a typical "devoted" religious person (guess what? Not all of us are religious, some us are even atheists!) but also inhumanly wise and collected at the tender age of 18. Because for her, people like me aren't people, no, we're props to help the lily white protagonists and give them advice. Christina's romance with Mark? Nothing more than a distraction from Mark/Kieran, something to keep the fans on their toes... because at the end, Mark is going to be with Kieran. Christina is not a character, she's just a prop. Don't get me started on "Perfect Diego"; Clare is not even capable of NOT writing his nickname every time he's mentioned in the narrative. Every single woman he comes across think he's "sexy" or "perfect", and he's just so goddamn "manly"! This it's not "representation", this is plain fetishization. Both Diego and Christina are treated like an "exotic" other. Shame on you, Clare. Now, get this, Christina's second last name is "Rosales", which means it comes from her mother and her side of her family. Diego's second last name is also "Rosales" which means both of their mothers got their first last name from their fathers, and are close in the family tree. This means these two are most likely first cousins! But of course, Clare wants to hand-wave this by making them related but not that related, only distantly. I call bullshit on this. This is nothing but a bunch of bullshit and shows how Clare has no idea how Hispanic/latino last names work. d) She has no idea on how to write combat/the proper use of medieval weaponry, yet she insists on using it Look, I know most people have skewed ideas about swords and the like because of Hollywood (no, swords didn't weight 40lbs; no, "greatswords" were used mostly as pole weapons, not for dueling and slashing, etc), but every time I read how Emma used Cortana on her back AND DURING TRAINING, I cringed (nevermind that swords were NEVER carried on the back, much less during combat). I know Ms. Clare is more interested in showing how "awesome" Emma is, but when your main character who is supposed to be a "great warrior" knows less than me, a scientist by training and a weapon enthusiast with VERY BASIC knowledge (and not hands-on experience) of medieval and modern combat/self-defense, it just comes across as lazy writing. Then again, we're talking about the same woman who can't even keep consistent the weapon her self-insert is using in a single line: Clary reached for the rapier, but Jace, having leaned the naginata against the wall, shook his head at her. "That claymore would be taller than you. Not that that's hard." That or Jace is just a moron who has no idea what a rapier and a claymore are. So I guess expecting her to do BASIC research is out of the question. After all, this is the same woman that thinks real life works like RPGs and one must use a single weapon for everything. Makes me wonder why she even bothers giving her precious shadowhunters such outdated weapons, instead of modern ones. Rule of cool I guess? Bonus: Clare knows nothing about medieval weaponry and when she gives her female characters whips (which ARE NOT WEAPONS), umbrellas, or other such ridiculous "weapons" in the name of "female empowerment" it makes me think of this comic: Honestly, Clare needs to stop pretending her books are anything but your run of the mill romance novels. Because that's all they are; worldbuilding and plot be damned.

Rated 1/5 on 2017-03-05

Manon Blackbeak deserved better. Chaol deserved better. Dorian deserved better. Fuck, even Celaena/Alein deserved better. (Rowan can burn in hell for all I care). Get the hell out of here with your shitty new characters, your sexist gender roles, and your biphobia. Believe it or not, not all women need to end up dating a man, and we bisexuals aren't similar to "whores" nor we do "anything that moves." Fuck you, Maas. Did you forget the series is supposed to be fantasy/High fantasy and not smut? Hell, it's not even well-written smut, but cheap erotica. If I wanted that, I'd read your stereotypical Harlequin novel.

Rated 1/5 on 2017-02-01

Drugs are bad mmm'okay? Let's erase Magnus memories of the event anyway, because this is how you do character development, kids! Honestly? I don't understand why Clare keeps pretending Magnus is bisexual: all of his important and lasting relationships are with other men. His relationships with women are rarely expanded upon in the narrative, or are utterly unhealthy and abusive. If CC wants to write a gay man then she should write a gay man, but she also should stop pretending Magnus is "bisexual representation" because he's not. At least there was no Raphael; that's a plus in my book.

I hate almost everything about this book, but this part... this part made me seethe: Clary reached for the rapier, but Jace, having leaned the naginata against the wall, shook his head at her. "That claymore would be taller than you. Not that that's hard." Jesus Christ... Did Jace flunk Weapons 101, or is he just an idiot? (Both, I'll go with both)

--- 13. The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner (Twilight, #3.5) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2017-02-01

Meyer, you aren't a talentless hack; no, you're a talentless, misogynist, misanthropist, sexist, racist hack. In a way, it's nice to see you haven't changed at all. Okay, I'm sorry, that was rude... This "novella" manages to be even more sexist than the other Twilight books. Bree is an useless lump that's only capable of rational though when a MAN is near. Forget feminism (ACTUAL feminism, not the feel-good variety liberals like to sell), forget empowerment, if a man isn't at your side your life is worth nothing! Meyer tries to tell us that her female characters are "smart" because they read. I'm sorry, but reading for a hobby has no direct correlation with someone cognitive functions. Plus, It's hard to believe that they are smart when they're incapable of any critical thinking. Ugh. I have some many (unkind) feelings towards this book. I'm just going to leave this link: http://das-sporking.livejournal.com/2... Because frankly, there's nothing more I can add to other reviews here.

Rated 1/5 on 2017-02-01

Image taken from this reviewer. There is really nothing else I can say that hasn't been said by other reviewers, so I'm just going to add a quick rant: "Alpha male" is the worst concept ever created (No dears, there is no such thing, humans are much more complex than that; and the theory has been disproven in wolves, so there's that). You know what I would do to an "Alpha male" if I ever met one? I would punch him in his stupid face. Your precious "alphas" are nothing but abusers than should be in jail.

Dear authors: Do some research about wolves before trying to write about their "society". Wolves are nothing like hyenas. * They don't function with a "hierarchy", they function like family. The "Alpha wolf" is a myth. Stop mangling wolf pack dynamics so you can excuse your disgusting rape fantasies in the name of "realism". Sincerely, a biologist. *Now, a book about "werehyenas", where the females hold all the power, would be a delight.

--- 17. Vampire Academy (Vampire Academy, #1) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2017-01-08

VA is a hard book for me to review; on one hand I find the premise and the book name to be utterly ridiculous, on the other hand, I actually enjoyed reading about Rose: she is tough, confident, doesn't suffer fools gladly and her best friend is another woman, whom she shares a bond of trust and actual affection. She may have her TSTL moments, but compared to most YA "heroines" out there, she comes across as pretty clever (then again, most YA "heroines" out there are the walking definition of TSTL). Despite all of the above, the book fails on so many levels that I can't get myself to give it a 3-star rating. The world building was mediocre at best, without any regard for the most basic Mendelian genetics. I won't get started on the relationship between Moroi and Dhampir, since other people have covered that point better than me. Dimitir Belikov is your typical "dark and brooding" pseudo-alpha male that also happens to suffer from male-entitlement syndrome, and engages in slut-shaming (which many reviewers here also seem to do, but I digress). Leaving aside the age difference between him and Rose, or that Rose is obviously confusing "lust" between "love", the fact is that Mr. Belikov has a non-existent personality and the relationship between him and Rose is superficial best.

Rated 1/5 on 2017-01-04

Thank God it was FREE, no way I'd waste money in this trite. I mean, it's my own fault because since the main character description ("Tehee, no way anyone can be interested in Science and in Sports, Nerds vs Jocks! This is the 80s people!") I knew it was going to be bad. It's like the writer got stuck in a High School mentality and never grew up past it. The "plot" is just a rehearsal of the Hunger Games, which granted is not a big sin or anything, there's plenty of book with similar plots. But while the Hunger Games managed to write teenage characters with seriousness, the writing in this book is juvenile at best and just plain awful at worst. Our main character it's not even as smart as the author wants us to believe; she's just a brat that can memorise information, but she's not intelligent at all. Now, I understand this is a very... American thing, you know? You're either a "klutzy" nerd or a "dumb" jock and nothing in-between (I guess my nerdy ass who also does weight lifting never got the memo!) but for me, this whole "divide" is just ridiculous. Athleticism is just another skill, and while not everyone can become an Olympic athlete, this doesn't mean being-in-shape is useless. This wouldn't have bothered me so much if the character was just a normal teen who needed to get in shape for combat (Combat is strenuous, and it takes a different kind of mentality too), but no, she had to be a "timid and utterly weak" NERD. Don't waste your time with this sad excuse for a book, it's not worth it, even when it's FREE.

When will I be free of the Herondales and their melodrama and puerile angst? When? Why can't they just die and take their angst with them? This story wasn't even about Magnus, but about that waste-of-space that is James Herondale. I don't think is a good sign when you're trying to paint your protagonist as "sympathetic" but instead he just comes across as really... punch-able. Yes, I want to punch him, just to see if the can keep being all "melodramatic" while I break his nose and his pretty face.

Rated 3/5 on 2017-01-04

The only reason this has 3 stars is because of both Ragnor and Catarina; I'd love to read more about them and their backstory. They have so much potential as characters, but like everything Clare does, their potential gets squanderes to focus on the "pretty boy by another name" (James is Will is Julian is Jace is Magnus in the short stories) and their puerile angst. Same old, same old.

--- 23. Hot Gimmick, Vol. 1 (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2017-01-04

I always tell myself I'm done with shojo/shoujo. It's been years since I was a wide-eyed teenage girl and I just can't buy into the toxic romantic tropes that try to sell "rape, manipulation and submission" as love, when there are countless studies out there that prove how damaging this actually is. The fact that this came from Japan is not an excuse, but rather an example of the sad state of the media in that country; a country that still thinks women are lesser, or that they need to be lesser to be attractive protagonists (less intelligent, less experienced - take a look at the disgusting Itazura na Kiss manga, which granted is not as misogynistic as this one) and that they should submit to men because this somehow makes them "strong"; cultural and moral relativism be damned. This is manga is your stereotypical shoujo. The misogynistic tropes, the misogynistic male leads, the "virginal", "shy" heroine and the weak plot barely held together with potential rape scenes (of course) on every other page. "Brooding, cocky controlling wannabe alpha male" are not sexy, they only make want to grab them by the seam of their clothes and throw them to the floor, judo style, and then stomp on their necks like they show you on self-defence classes, and save other women from having to deal with these misogynists. Don't get me wrong, as someone who has dealt with abusive relationships in the past I think is important to write about them, to explore what makes them that way and how one can cope or even escape them... the problem with this type of books/manga is that they try to portray absurd power imbalances and abusive relationship as something desirable, as the norm, and that is something I'll always condemn. Take the new Marvel TV show for example: Killgrave is a rapist and a misogynist, he's the villain and at the end of the series Jessica breaks his neck, a fitting punishment for all the pain he caused to other people and to her , now that is a good story.

--- 24. Queen of Shadows (Throne of Glass, #4) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2017-01-04

Look, Throne of Glass has never been a "good" much less "amazing" series, but it had its moments, and it had interesting characters, especially on the male side; male characters who weren't your typical "alpha" bullshit YA books always have... until this god-awful book, that is, where everyone and their mother started to act completely out of character. Maas, if you need your characters to behave out-of-character so your dumb, boring ship can happen then you're not a good writer, you're a hack. Chaol, Celaena and even Rowan (oh, how much I hate that one-dimensional waste of space) deserved better. I side-eyed the author ever since she killed Nehemia, because hey, let's kill this WoC so the "pure" white female protagonist can have a character arc, that's not racist at all, nope! Yet I continued reading because I don't like to leave series unfinished (come on, I read the Mortal Instruments series despite being awful, just because I needed to know how it ended), hoping that the writing would improve. It didn't improve, it got worse. Much worse. Not only Maas managed to write the most obnoxious harlequin-like novel masquerading as an "epic" fantasy story (I couldn't care less about the sexual tension between Rowan and Aelin, or their dumb "banter"), she also took the racist cues from those books. In the previous book, she killed Sorscha, who granted was such a useless and boring character ("super shy WoC who just exist to be a love interest and then die" is not something a WoC like me wants to read) so yet again a WoC had to die so Maas' precious protagonists can have a character arc. Luckily no WoC died this time because I don't think there was one in this book. Fuck you, Maas. Manon was the silver lining of the book, but only in this book... since I know what happens to her in Empire of Storms. Spoiler: she falls in love with Dorian, because in Maas world every female character must with paired with a man; please Maas, do you even know your own characters?

--- 27. Under the Never Sky (Under the Never Sky, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2017-01-04

Under the Never Sky reads like 97% of fanfiction (mediocre or worse) for a certain video game series*, fanfiction written by teenagers of all people; speaking of which, that series happens to possess a much better world-building, one that actually makes sense (most of the time), is explained in depth, and doesn't leave you with unanswered questions regarding "how the world works". The "heroine" is supposed to be "sheltered", but she comes across as, frankly, an idiot in true YA female protagonist fashion; making female characters basically "dumb as fuck" seems to be the trend these days. Apparently, intelligence is a trait that we are supposed to find too "overpowered" for a heroine. The male protagonist doesn't fare much better, being only a collection or badly executed tropes and cliches. His relationship with our esteemed heroine makes him seem more like an animal outside of the Homo genus, although still a mammal. I'm not going to discuss the ridiculous "Science" or the inability of the author to understand basic human physiology. I just wish authors would actually do some sort research before trying to write how the human body works, it is really not that hard. *If you know what series I'm talking about, go read a fanfiction for it, because some of them are actually better written than this crap.

--- 28. The Shadow Reader (Shadow Reader, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2017-01-04

Sometimes I wish that people who haven't even read about actual combat or real life spies wouldn't be permitted to write this type of books. Harsh, but true. Dear Miss William, do you really expect me to believe that someone (man or woman, girl or boy) who was actually working as a spy wouldn't know the first thing about combat? Spies fight only as a last resort, and even if they do, there's a high possibility that they will lose against a more trained opponent, but this doesn't mean they don't know how to protect themselves, how to fight. Why would the King even allow her to work for him? Is he an idiot? A really shitty King? Is he trying to get her killed? Just because she has "powers" and a "knight" at her side, doesn't mean she is ready for actual espionage. With such a dangerous job, why hasn't she bothered to learn how to shoot a firearm. She doesn't have to become a warrior or a soldier, she just need to know how to take care of herself. Oh, right, we can't have your female protagonist be competent in her own fucking job, she needs to be a moron so her "love interest" can rescue her sorry ass. Now, I could believe this turn of events only if she was still a teenager girl, one who was learning the ropes of her job and her new reality, but she's a 26 year old grown ass woman who has been doing this for ten years. It just doesn't makes sense. As a last note, I want to add that I'm tired of these "sexy guys", and the moronic "love triangles". They are overused, they are boring, and they only serve to bog down your narrative.

Shadow Kiss is like a TV Series 3rd and 4th seasons: things are finally starting to pick up, but we all know things can only go downhill for now on. Of all of the Vampire Academy books, I enjoyed this one he most. The prose is still weak and simplistic, but considering that this books is more like brain candy for me, I can't really complain. Rose is finally showing some maturity, just a tiny bit, and Lissa is growing on her powers and strength. Dimitri is still Boring, with a capital "b", but Adrian is a welcome addition to the cast: he seems to actually have a personality and care about Rose as a person. But hey, maybe is because is have never liked the "strong-silent-and-boring-as-fuck" male leads. I couldn't feel sorry for Dimitri at the end of the book; I felt sorry for Rose, but I all could think when *that* happened was "Good riddance, and please don't come back."

After the 5th book, I had very low expectations regarding the series. I hated Dimitri, and I started to dislike Rose and her obsession with him. I was hoping Richelle would go and kill him, a fitting end for him, and Rose could've finally moved on, but no; no, that would've been a compelling narrative. But of course, according to the Laws of YA(TM) the "first love" is all that matters, falling in love with someone else, let alone sleeping with someone else, is a terrible thing; because, of course in the 5th book Rose was this close to sleep with Adrian, you know, the actually nice guy, but we know that would've "tainted" her, right Mead? At least Mead finally put these characters out of their misery. Well, not really, poor Adrian having to suffer through Bloodlines after having his heart broken by Rose (because it's not "cheating" if you're "in love", talk about being immature and selfish).

Even Cassandra Clare writes better characters and plot, and manages not to be utterly sexist and creepy. I think that says it all, don't you?

Keladry is my favourite character from Tamora's world, I like her even more than Alanna. Her quiet, almost cold demeanour is something I greatly identify with.

Yet another "dystopian" that seems to work without logic. (Will add more this later.)

Abusive, mentally unstable dude that uses BDSM to abuse women, but It's okay because he's just using it to "cope", oh, and he's "hot" and "rich". Nothing to see here, folks, just another twisted romance novel with juvenile prose that tell us how far we have regressed when it comes to feminism.

Rated 2/5 on 2012-12-29

A mediocre-to-awful book, which I liked at the first read, but after a few re-readings, I have to say that Angelfall is simply not worth more than 2 stars. Review will come soon.

Rated 1/5 on 2012-12-29

A books that reminds me why I simply don't bother with YA anymore. Flat characters, a cipher heroine, mediocre prose, and an awfully written love triangle. Nothing more to this books, nothing but your typical YA formula. [More to come]
