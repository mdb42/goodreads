# Proposal: Book Review Sentiment Analysis and Reviewer Clustering

## Sentiment Classification

### Technical Approach

- Train multiple classification models using the star ratings as ground truth
- Implement a multi-dimensional sentiment analysis rather than just positive/negative:
  - **Intensity**: How strongly negative/positive the language is
  - **Focus**: What aspects of books the review criticizes (writing quality, plot, characters, pacing)
  - **Constructiveness**: Whether criticism offers alternatives or is purely negative
  - **Subjectivity**: How much personal opinion vs. objective analysis
  - **Consistency**: If the reviewer's sentiment matches their numerical rating

### User Interface Elements

1. **Classifier Training Interface**
   - Data selection panel: Choose which subset of reviews to use for training
   - Model configuration panel: Select features and parameters
   - Training progress visualization
   - Model evaluation metrics dashboard

2. **Sentiment Analysis Dashboard**
   - Multi-dimensional radar chart showing a reviewer's sentiment profile across dimensions
   - Comparison view to see how a reviewer compares to average patterns
   - Text highlighting that shows which phrases contributed to each sentiment dimension

3. **Reviewer Search & Filter**
   - Search by sentiment profile (e.g., "Find extremely negative but constructive reviewers")
   - Filter by specific dimension scores
   - Sort by overall negativity or specific dimension

4. **Review Text Analysis**
   - Interactive text view showing color-coded sentiment markers
   - Phrase extraction showing most characteristic negative expressions
   - Side-by-side comparison of multiple reviews from the same reviewer

5. **Prediction Testing**
   - Input field for pasting new review text
   - Sentiment prediction visualization showing expected rating
   - Confidence metrics for the prediction

## Genre-Specific Reviewer Clustering

### Technical Approach
- Apply clustering algorithms (k-means, hierarchical clustering) to group reviewers based on their genre-specific criticism patterns
- Features for clustering could include:
  - Distribution of ratings across different genres
  - Sentiment intensity by genre
  - Linguistic patterns specific to certain genres
  - Comparative metrics (how a reviewer's ratings deviate from average by genre)

### User Interface Elements

1. **Genre Clustering Visualization**
   - Interactive cluster map showing reviewer groupings
   - Color-coded by dominant genre or criticism style
   - Adjustable parameters to reconfigure clusters in real-time
   - Ability to zoom in on specific clusters

2. **Reviewer Profile View**
   - Genre breakdown chart showing a reviewer's activity across book categories
   - Comparative ratings chart (their ratings vs. average) by genre
   - Characteristic phrases from their reviews in different genres

3. **Critic Archetype Browser**
   - Gallery of identified reviewer archetypes (e.g., "The Literary Purist," "The Genre Enthusiast," "The Cross-Genre Critic")
   - Representative reviewers for each archetype
   - Common linguistic patterns and rating behaviors

4. **Genre Comparison Tool**
   - Side-by-side view of how the same reviewer approaches different genres
   - Highlight significant differences in language, rating patterns, and focus areas

## Critic Similarity Measurement

### Technical Approach
- Leverage your existing indexing and weighting code for document similarity
- Represent reviewers as "documents" using their aggregated review text
- Apply modified TF-IDF to identify distinctive reviewer vocabulary and patterns
- Use cosine similarity to find reviewers with matching criticism styles
- Create embeddings of reviewer profiles using their rating distributions, commonly used words, and reviewing patterns

### User Interface Elements

1. **Reviewer Similarity Search**
   - Input field to select a "seed" reviewer
   - Similarity threshold slider to control how closely matched results should be
   - Results displayed as a ranked list with similarity scores
   - Quick comparison view showing key similarities between reviewers

2. **Similarity Network Visualization**
   - Interactive graph showing connections between similar reviewers
   - Node size representing review volume
   - Edge thickness indicating similarity strength
   - Ability to filter by genre, time period, or other attributes

3. **Comparative Analysis Panel**
   - Side-by-side view of two reviewers' statistics
   - Shared vocabulary highlighting
   - Common books both have reviewed with comparison of ratings
   - Linguistic style comparison metrics

4. **Reviewer Recommendation Engine**
   - "If you find this reviewer insightful, you might also like..." functionality
   - Bookmark feature to save interesting reviewer profiles
   - Export options for similarity data
