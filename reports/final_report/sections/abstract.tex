This project explores sentiment analysis using the UCSD Goodreads Book Graph 
datasets. We examine book reviews and the users who wrote them, focusing on 
predicting star ratings from review text and analyzing cross-domain adaptation of 
sentiment classifiers. Additional dimensions of analysis include review 
categorization, genre-specific sentiment patterns, and the development of a 
parametric search interface for the extensive dataset.
