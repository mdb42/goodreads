While using a Na\"ive Bayes classifier alone may not be the most reliable classifier when used in isolation, it still offers some meaningful insight into
the characteristics of our Goodreads dataset. The clustering analysis used in this experiment gives us an interesting perspective about users on Goodreads, which could be used
to improve recommendation algorithms over time.
Overall, while both the classification and clustering approaches may require further refinement and external validation, this work establishes a strong foundation for continued exploration of sentiment analysis and user modeling in literary domains.
