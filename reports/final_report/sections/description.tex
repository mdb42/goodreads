Using the UCSD Goodreads Book Graph datasets, we propose to examine book reviews and
the users who wrote them. The dataset contains information about 2,360,655 books
(1,521,962 works, 400,390 book series, 829,529 authors); 876,145 users; 228,648,342
user-book interactions in users' shelves (including 112,131,203 reads and 104,551,549
ratings). A GitHub repo containing the source code of our project can be viewed at
