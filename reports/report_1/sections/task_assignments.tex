Matthew has already covered a lot of ground in loading the datasets to be used for the project,
complete with a working GUI and database that makes it easy for a user to interact with the model.
Beyond this initial foundation and any future collaboration required to connect the model from 
beginning to end, we'll split responsibilities for building the model into two:

\subsection{James}
	James will be tasked with handling the feature extraction and classification side of
	the modeling pipeline, including the preprocessing of the incoming data stream before feeding
	each review through the model.
	
\subsection{Matthew}
	Matthew will implement the clustering side of the model, as well as any tweaks to the incoming
	amount of data and the database as necessary. We're aware that this project is going to use an
	excessive amount of data, so a subset of the data may need to be decided on prior to 
	submission of the project.
