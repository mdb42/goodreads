To construct the sentiment analyzer, we'll be using a Na\"ive Bayes classifier to make decisions on
the sentiment ``rating'' of a review. This classifier will be fed information
from a feature extraction pipeline using \textit{tf-idf} over tokenized and stemmed
reviews. Otherwise known as term frequency-inverse document frequency, this feature
extraction method helps determine how ``important'' a word is to any given review. From these, we're looking to have the model generate an average sentiment
score on a scale from 1 through 5, matching up with the five-star review score that
users can give a book on Goodreads. After this, these reviews can be clustered by
sentiment score, which will provide us with a way to group individual reviewers based on that score, review frequency, and other behavioral metrics.

Once the model has been trained on the Goodreads dataset, we'll proceed with applying
the model to a set of movie reviews and examine how effective the model is in
cross-domain applications.
