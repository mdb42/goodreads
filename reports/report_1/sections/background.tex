To construct the sentiment analyzer, we will be using a Na\"ive Bayes classifier to make decisions on the sentiment ``rating'' of a review. This classifier will be fed information
from a feature extraction pipeline using \textit{tf-idf} over tokenized and stemmed
reviews. This feature extraction method helps determine how ``important'' a word is to any given 
review. From these, we are looking to predict a star rating on a discrete 1--5 scale, matching
Goodreadsâ€™ review system. After this, we will cluster reviewers based on their aggregate sentiment 
scores, review frequency, and other behavioral metrics.

Once the model has been trained on the Goodreads dataset, we will proceed with applying
the model to a set of movie reviews and examine how effective the model is in
cross-domain applications.
