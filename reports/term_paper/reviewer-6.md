_Resigned Skeptic_. Their tone is consistently low-energy but perceptive, never angry, just **tired of being let down**. They DNF more than most, trust their boredom as a verdict, and write with dry precision. No dramatics, just the shrug of someone who’s seen too much bad YA fiction.

--- 1. A Game For All The Family (★★★★☆) ---

Rated 4/5 on 2016-08-27

This book was a five-star read until the somewhat weird ending. I was pretty confused by Justine's logic. And it would be good to know why Anne wanted to kill her so much. It has been said in other reviews that the story feels far-fetched, as do the characters. To me, it was part of the book's universe, its charm. The book (as far as I see it) didn't try to be plausible or even realistic. The author wanted to show absurd as its purest (again, as far as I can judge). And I love absurd. It's tough to do well, but when it's achieved, it can be brilliant. Our life is absurd. From ridiculous decisions our governments make on daily basis to reactions from people you meet on the street or even (and most often) your own family. In most aspects, life makes so little sense that your head might explode. That's why I loved this book.

Rated 1/5 on 2016-08-25

I usually don't abandon a book after reading 60% of it, but this was getting nowhere. It's horribly boring, confusing and pointless. I feel sorry for the original Peter Pan who had to turn into a villain for no good reason at all. That'll teach me to read more retellings. I don't like them.

  

--- 3. In a Dark, Dark Wood (★★★★☆) ---

Rated 4/5 on 2016-07-07

This was a very decent read, and I actually didn't find the plot as unlikely as other comments suggested. I just found the very last lines annoyingly cryptic.

  

--- 4. The Mystery of Hollow Places (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2016-04-28

I found this book horribly boring. I read 80%, hoping that something interesting would start happening, but when Imogene started acting like a bitch, I gave up and skimmed through the rest just because I'm falling behind on my reading challenge.

  

--- 5. Iron to Iron (Wolf By Wolf, #1.5) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2016-04-13

I found this story, if short, rather useless. It didn't add much to what could already be guess in Wolf by Wolf. Besides, stakes are entirely different and it really all is about the race for both Adele and Luka, so the setting loses its meaning entirely. A shame.

  

--- 6. The Death House (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2016-03-12

Rather boring. Sounded good in theory, but didn't live up to the promise.

  

--- 7. The Evening Spider (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2016-03-10

Well, it was a pleasant read, but I failed to see the point. The ending is just... major letdown. There was no climax per see, and when my Kindle presented me with the Author's Note (useless, IMO, since the fact that the murder was real historical fact doesn't add anything to the story), I was like "huh? And that's it?" The entire book feels like a lot of aimless wandering around, since no one has clear goal and thus no one achieves anything. Too bad.

  

--- 8. The Killing Jar (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2016-03-05

I wonder if the YA wearing itself thin, because the endless parade of similar, first-person plaintive and whimpering heroines has certainly worn my patience thread-bare thin. There is no emotion, no depth, no nothing but weak attempts at standard originality. DNF.

  

--- 9. The Queen of the Tearling (The Queen of the Tearling, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2016-03-04

Remarkably boring and slow moving.

  

--- 10. Wolf by Wolf (Wolf by Wolf, #1) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2016-02-22

This book is hard to rate, because it held so much promise and failed to deliver. I was especially frustrated by the author's note, because it sounded more powerful and genuine than the story itself. It sounded like something written with the author's soul and real thought behind the dreadful what-if she bases the book on. The novel itself is lacking: character development (Yael is plain and boring. It's as if the author tried too hard to make her bad ass and just made her cold and detached instead), excitement and coherence (what does that weird race have to do with anything? Ruined credibility for me), depth (which is sad to admit, considering the heavy topic. Again, the author's note in the end held more emotion than the entire novel. A shame).

  

--- 11. Gates of Thread and Stone (Gates of Thread and Stone #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2016-02-19

Boring. Just very boring.

  

--- 12. The Ice Twins (★★★★☆) ---

Rated 4/5 on 2016-02-16

This was a nice quick read. A bit confusing in place (the last chapter was kind of weird), but I certainly enjoyed the story overall.

  

--- 13. 14 Days to Die (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2016-02-08

DNF at 35%. This book started good enough, but then it just began to drag. Instead of doing something about the situation, the MC watches CSI, feels sorry for herself all the time and spits in her husband's food. Wow, mature.

  

--- 14. Mortal Danger (Immortal Game, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2016-01-30

DNF at 40%. This book is boring. By 40% I should already understand what's going on, shouldn't I? I don't. It's just a mess without any clear idea behind it. So, Edie wants revenge but as long as she's not pouring acid over mean girls' faces revenge becomes an okay thing? No, I don't get it. I don't get anything in this book, and I'm moving on.

  

--- 15. Red Queen (Red Queen, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2016-01-19

God, this book is a mess. It reads like a mix of recent dystopias and fantasy all blend together in a tasteless soup. The Selection vibe specifically drove me over the edge and made me DNF. Ugh.

  

--- 16. The House (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2016-01-19

This book was just ridiculous, and I couldn't finish it. The idea behind the story is good and seems original enough, but the execution is poor. Basically, they were just walking around, holding hands, visiting the weird house, and I was hopelessly waiting for something to happen. I suppose it did, eventually, but too late for me.

  

--- 17. Court of Fives (Court of Fives, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2016-01-19

This book is one major disappointment. It was supposed to be fantasy, but it's a dystopia in disguise, complete with a society so ridiculously unfair that it could have easily come after some major disaster on Earth that forced the men in this book (and the author too, apparently) to hate women. I won't even dive into the plot, because there is no plot. Wouldn't any respectful book on the craft tell you that a character has have to have a goal? What is the character's goal? Participate in the competition she can't even win? Why? What for the love of God for? What is she trying to achieve? Anyway, this book lost me when the MC was slapped by her supposedly loving father for talking to a darn lord. Seriously. What was she supposed to do when he spoke to her? Ignore him? I don't understand the world-building in this book at all, it just makes everyone unequal, humiliated and miserable. Sorry, but I'm moving on.

  

--- 18. A Madness So Discreet (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2016-01-19

Didn't finish and don't regret it. It's kind of hard to explain, but this is one of those books that aim at gritty-real and end up with gratuitous violence. Everything is too much and just not subtle enough to make me feel anything but irritation. I know little about asylums and won't argue with historical accuracy, since I'm no expert, but it was just not executed subtly enough, in my opinion. That's all I have to say, since I didn't get far enough to judge plot or anything.

  

--- 19. All Our Yesterdays (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2016-01-19

** spoiler alert ** This book was just plain bizarre. I loved it at some extent, I found the plot convincing in ways that other time travel stories weren't. But it just all went to hell when Em started wanting to save herself first, when she started loving herself and caring for herself (albeit Marina, not herself entirely) more than anything else and it just... Well, it doesn't sit well with me. I never wanted to reach back in the past and give myself a hug, so I can't sympathize with this strange fantasy the author has...

  

--- 20. The Compound (The Compound, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2016-01-19

Boring. I couldn't care less for the MC and his problems.

  

--- 21. Legend (Legend, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2016-01-19

I was ready to like this book, and I even did after a very promising and intense first chapter. Then, things went from bad to worse. June and Day are both very hard to connect to. I understand that their world is very different from ours, but still characters should be likeable and understandable. If not, it's a pain. I struggled with this book for a while, and the last drop for me was the torture scene. Sorry, I'm not about to read about tortures in YA (or elsewhere, for that matter).

  

--- 22. The Kill Order (Maze Runner, #0.5) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2016-01-19

Unfortunately, this book is just plain boring. I couldn't force myself to finish it. I'd rather James Dashner wrote some about the Maze itself.

  

--- 23. Falling Kingdoms (Falling Kingdoms, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2016-01-12

Well, what to say of this book? It was entertaining enough to keep me going, but it's a very mediocre read. It reads like a teenage drama with dress-up in medieval make-believe, because nothing feels legit about this particular world-building. Character voices are poorly done, so much so that they blend together, creating something hardly memorable at all. A shame.

  

--- 24. Need (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2015-11-25

I'm halfway through and not sure I'm going to finish. I disagree with most people who say that it's dumb to believe NEED promises. It's not, because most of us want (or even need) things that can't be easily obtained or bought. And some of these people are desperate enough to buy into NEED's concept. Yes, I am talking about myself right now. That's not what pisses me off about this book. It's Kaylee. The chick just thinks that everyone MUST test to be kidney donors and if they don't, they're selfish and cowards. Well, news flash for her, it's one thing to donate one's blood, for example, and entirely another to live with just one kidney. Guess what? It's a real sacrifice and not everyone is ready to do that for a stranger. I hate when others just assume that if you don't give them something willingly, you're a coward and despicable. So, yes, the MC makes me want to slap her and the author kind of too for making it okay for her character to selfishly believe her needs MUST be granted just because she doesn't want this particular thing for herself.

  

--- 25. The Monogram Murders (★★★★☆) ---

Rated 4/5 on 2014-09-16

After reading some reviews, I decided I should speak up too. First and foremost, I'm surprised some reviewers should insist so much the book hadn't been written by Christie. Obviously, it wasn't, and it has Sophie Hannah's name on the cover. As a writer myself, I can't imagine why one would want to embrace another writer's voice, but as Poirot fan I was quite pleased that Sophie Hannah was willing to try (and I hope, she would create more Poirot mysteries). Now, on to more details and things I liked and disliked: - I suppose this comes more from Christie herself (since I noticed this in her novels) rather than from Hannah. Sometimes, Poirot's notion of psychology strikes me as odd. He assumes that people are consistent in their behavior, in the way the feel and the way they think, which often allows Christie to make shortcuts in Poirot's reasoning. The same happened here, when he said that it was inconsistent of Jennie to blame Patrick Ive for loving Nancy when she accepted him loving Frances. For one, it was not inconsistent at all, in my opinion. One was a wife, the other was a mistress. And Jennie proved it wasn't inconsistent at all by murdering Nancy upon discovering that Nancy did sleep with Patric after all. But I just thought that if people were always consistent, it would have saved us all the world of trouble... - As it was mentioned by some, Catchpool is a major annoyance. Not only is he bizarre (and how many times should the author repeat the 'hold his hand, Edward' line? ), but he just doesn't sound like he deserves to be a policeman (then again, Japp often doesn't sound like it either, but well). And besides, as a lover of neat POV's, I didn't like the parts where the narration shifted to Poirot, including what he thought or felt. I assume he later told those things to Catchpool, but well... There could have been a more elegant solution. - The mystery itself was a little over-complicated (but that is the flaw of Christie's novels as well, that and a bizarre motive),yet enjoyable enough to keep me reading in the late hours. - This book definitely provided the entertainment I expected, which cannot be said about all the books I read. I didn't have enormously high hopes for it, so those hopes weren't deceived. I'm not a Poirot specialist and wouldn't judge how well the character was portrayed in comparison to the original. I liked him well enough, and could picture David Suchet conduct this investigation as he did with the original novels. - All in all, I think this book is mostly a success, a tribute to Agatha Christie's brilliant detective and a few pleasant evenings for occasional mystery lovers like me.

  

--- 26. These Broken Stars (Starbound, #1) (★★★★☆) ---

Rated 4/5 on 2014-06-06

It was a fine and quick read, one I enjoyed quite a lot. I'm surprised that the story isn't continuing (I didn't feel like all the questions had answers), but we'll see what the sequel has in store.

  

--- 27. Shatter Me (Shatter Me, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2012-12-07

Well, this book is a major blah. I wish there was a negative rating, then it would rise pretty high for me. It all began with an interesting style and setting that made a never kept promise. Gradually, the author perhaps got bored with all the unusual style thingies and just inserted them here and there on random. Since the moment Juliette left the asylum, the plot became stupider and stupider in increasing pace. There are too many factual approximations to start naming them all. Not mentioning, that I never understood what kind of world the characters evolved in (whatever the heck happened to the normal government, climate and everything else?) The romance factor is just plain boring, IMO. Adam is worse than your average Edward, and I often wished I could reach inside the book and choke Juliette when she would ask again "oh, why do you care for me?" which would provoke another endless reply, based on their childhood memories. Ugh. And finally, what's with that ending? The characters achieved nothing but find some obscure organization, we still have no idea why Warner and Adam can touch our untouchable heroine, what is going on with all the superhero convention and when do we save the world?
