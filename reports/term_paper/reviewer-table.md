- **Primary**: _Fault-Finder with Integrity_ (Pope’s most dangerous critic — sometimes wrong, sometimes utterly right)
    
- **Bordering on**: _Rightful Judge_, especially in reviews that call out cultural misrepresentation with surgical precision

This reviewer often praises the _idea_ of a story, or its early promise — only to then dissect its collapse. The disappointment runs deep because it stems from **unmet potential**. This is someone who _wanted_ to like what they read.

Reviewer #3 isn’t just a data point — they’re an **essayist in disguise**, and trying to compress them would risk flattening their intent. They deserve a slow read, not a scatterplot.

They're _fascinatingly conflicted_ — both sincere and sarcastic, critical but vulnerable. Their reviews read like dramatic monologues, full of extended metaphors, backtracking, and big emotional swings. Almost like a solo performance about disappointment in fiction.

They're arguably the funniest yet — snide, self-aware, and more _stand-up comic_ than _literary judge_. Their takedowns have rhythm, structure, and comedic timing, even when they're genuinely annoyed.

_Resigned Skeptic_. Their tone is consistently low-energy but perceptive, never angry, just **tired of being let down**. They DNF more than most, trust their boredom as a verdict, and write with dry precision. No dramatics, just the shrug of someone who’s seen too much bad YA fiction.
