## Analysis:
### 🕯️ _The Disillusioned Optimist_

---

### 🔍 **Thematic Patterns & Ideological Markers**

#### 📚 _Former Enthusiast Energy_

This reviewer often praises the _idea_ of a story, or its early promise — only to then dissect its collapse. The disappointment runs deep because it stems from **unmet potential**. This is someone who _wanted_ to like what they read.

Examples:

- _“The first book in this series held promise but I think I give up...”_
    
- _“There is an awesome book that’s unfortunately buried under...”_
    
- _“I love Hopkins’ books and her poetry. But the poetry in _Burned_ was just bad.”_
    

#### 🔎 _Targeted Narrative Criticism_

Focuses intensely on:

- **World-building flaws**
    
- **Inconsistencies in character development**
    
- **Pacing and plot structure**
    
- **Unrealistic romantic dynamics** (especially those bordering on abuse)
    

These aren’t flippant jabs — they’re **practical objections** grounded in readerly logic.

#### ⚖️ _Ethical Framing_

Multiple reviews highlight:

- Abusive relationship dynamics being normalized (_Waiting for You_, _Fifty Shades_ parallels)
    
- Glorification of attempted rape in _The Shade of the Moon_
    
- The reviewer consistently holds texts accountable to **moral clarity**, especially in YA.
    

> _“It is not romantic. It's just disturbing.”_  
> _“I just can't with this book.”_

---

### ✍️ **Voice & Style**

- **Concise and plainspoken**, often offering a brief summary and then diving into flaws.
    
- **Pedagogical moments**: comments framed as if to explain or instruct other readers or future authors.
    
- Occasional **one-liner burns** worthy of epigraphs:
    
    > _“I wish Goodreads had a zero stars option.”_  
    > _“She wanted it as much as I did... But later in the book she forgives him because he never actually raped the other girl.”_ ← Haunting in tone, and deeply rhetorical.

### 🧠 **Cognitive & Rhetorical Profile**

|Dimension|Trait|
|---|---|
|**Ethical Awareness**|High — especially regarding portrayals of consent, agency, and identity|
|**Genre Fluency**|Strong — references to series evolution, character arcs, common tropes|
|**Empathy Markers**|Yes — cares deeply about how characters _ought_ to be treated|
|**Rhetorical Strengths**|Brevity, clarity, moral edge|
|**Vulnerability**|Implied — tone suggests burnout, as if the magic of fiction has become more rare|

---

### 🧙 **Archetype Placement**

#### Pope’s Framework:

- **Primary**: _Prideful Contrarian_ — not contrarian for its own sake, but allergic to unearned praise
    
- **Secondary**: _Rightful Judge_ — especially in reviews where they stand up for ethical clarity in the face of genre indulgence
    

#### Alternate Framing:

> **“The Disillusioned Teacher”** — They’ve seen too much bad fiction to stay quiet. They don’t rage like Reviewer #1, but their voice comes with that weary, teacherly sigh: _"We could be doing so much better."_

---

### 🌟 One Last Quote

> _“I love Life As We Knew It. It is my go-to book for my high school students who don't like to read.”_  
> There it is — the crack in the armor. This isn’t a cynic. This is someone trying to save books from mediocrity because **books once saved them**, and might still save someone else.

The Johnson story was delightful. The Green story was pretty good and the Myracle story was ehhhh.

  

--- 2. Midnight Crossroad (Midnight, Texas, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2014-07-10

I read most of the Southern Vampire series (aside from the last few) and I enjoyed most of them. But I did not enjoy Midnight Crossroad at all. It's so boring. Nothing really happens and it is filled with descriptions of things that don't matter. For instance, "Bobo was sitting in a comfortable chair probably crafted sometime around the turn of the century. It was made of dark, ornately carved wood with faded crimson velvet cushions. He'd been sitting in this char for a month now, and he would miss it if the owner ever came back to redeem it. Of course, the guy should have taken it down to the Antique Gallery and Nail Salon, but he hadn't wanted to deal with 'fruitcakes,' as he'd so charmingly termed Joe and Chuy. After looking at the chair for twenty-four hours, Bob had positioned it in front of one of the wooden posts that went from floor to ceiling. He'd put an old table by it. The chair seemed at home in the maze of the pawnshop, and he was not instantly visible from the front door." Or, "Madonna's man was putting a bib on the baby and seemed to pretty busy with the process, so Manfred put off introducing himself." A good ninety percent of the book is full of description like those above that really don't serve to move the story forward. It feels like Harris was merely trying to hit a word/page count and did not create a fully developed story.

  

--- 3. Half Bad (The Half Bad Trilogy, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2014-05-25

I didn't hate it but I didn't really like very much about it and won't buy any of the rest of the series. I didn't like the narrator/protagonist (but I didn't particularly dislike him either) and I really didn't feel for him as a character despite the truly horrible things he goes through. I think the biggest problem is the distinct lack of world-building. The reader is given quite a bit of details about the world Nathan lives in but it feels more like an outline of a world instead of a complete one.

  

--- 4. Takedown Twenty (Stephanie Plum, #20) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2014-03-18

I love the cast of characters. The book is cute and funny. And it's the exact same thing as the previous 19 books. And that makes me sad as nothing has changed-nothing has moved forward or even backward. I don't know why I thought it'd be different. I think I'm completely over this series.

  

--- 5. The Shade of the Moon (Last Survivors, #4) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2013-10-19

I really, really wish that goodreads gave a zero star option. There were some serious issues with the book. Spoilers all over the place. 1) lack of characters that the reader can actually care about. Sarah has absolutely no qualities that make her likable. 2) The insta-love story. The main characters meet, they like each other and then his friends hate her so he refuses to acknowledge her in public. They spend very little time together (most of it not in public because of the friend's issues) and then they are in love. 3) The illogical world-building. This book takes place only a few years after the events of the first book. Yet, in that short amount of time the world is now a rigid class-based society where everyone accepts there roles because that's the way it is. 4) Jon's an idiot. For real, he's dumb. "'Do you mind being called a grubb?' Jon asked, picking at the strawberries. 'I mind the term,' Val said, 'it's offensive.' 'But everyone calls you that,' Jon said. 'Why be offended?'" Before the events of the first book, Jon was a teenager. He knew the world as it was and yet because of the bad world-building, he's acting as though he's never known anything but the rigid class-based society he now lives in. 5) And five is the big reason I can not like this book. "She wanted it as much as I did," Jon said. "I could tell. But she wouldn't admit it. She said it was a sin. She didn't care what I felt, how excited I was. What I wanted didn't matter. I didn't plan on hurting her. It was her fault for fighting me." The main character justifies attempted rape with the "she wanted it" excuse. Now Sarah (the love interest) has the right response and she demands that he leave and never talk to her again. But later in the book she forgives him because he never actually raped the other girl. I love, love, love Life As We Knew It. It is my go-to book for my high school students who don't like to read. And I'd be okay with Jon turning out to be a attempted-rapist d-bag if any of the other characters call him on his behavior. Everybody forgives him or sacrifices for him. I just can't with this book.

  

--- 6. Another Little Piece (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2013-09-05

I did not like this book. There were a ton of bits and pieces of the plot floating around and not enough connections to make a coherent plot. There are way too many unanswered questions and even if there is a sequel to clear stuff up, I don't care enough about the characters to read it.

  

--- 7. Time Thief (Time Thief, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2013-07-31

Goodreads really needs a DNF option. The writing was juvenile and what was especially annoying was how no one really talked to each other. It was irritating. Maybe something interesting did happen but I don't know because I only made it through the first half of the book and couldn't deal with anymore.

  

--- 8. Burned (Burned, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2013-07-21

I'm not Mormon but I do have issues with how faith is portrayed in the book. Hopkins brushes it off with a "every religion has its fanatics" but she never addresses the non-fanatics. Climax occurred at the end of the book and then we are left with nothing. Despite things happening in the novel and to the protagonist, there was absolutely no change in the protagonist herself. I love Hopkins' books and her poetry. But the poetry in Burned was just bad. It felt like she wrote the book in a rush and no one questioned it or edited it because she is Ellen Hopkins.

  

--- 9. Waiting for You (Waiting for You, #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2013-06-14

This book was disturbing. Dylan was possessive and violent and I spent most of the book thinking that Bailey should leave and leave quickly. I lost any hope for the book when he forced her head down to give him a blow job to apologize for some guy kissing her in a club. It is not romantic. It's just disturbing. I would put it on the same pile as 50 Shades.

  

--- 10. The Twelve (The Passage, #2) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2013-03-30

Goodreads seriously needs a did not finish choice for rating. I liked The Passage. But this one was so bogged down with so many characters that I could not possibly care about any of them including the ones that I liked in the first book. And the narrative was all over the place. It could have been pared down significantly.

  

--- 11. Beauty Queens (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2012-07-15

There is an awesome book that's unfortunately buried under so many unnecessary pieces. If you ignore the "Classified" chapters, and the commercials breaks and pretty much the last 80 pages of the book, then there is an excellent book. But all of the crap just suffocates the book under a "look at me, I'm so clever" barrage of made up shows and products and outrage at the media's portrayal of young women. And worse, it's poorly done.

  

--- 12. Cryer's Cross (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2011-07-05

I was very disappointed. The book felt like a detailed outline instead of an actual book. It felt rushed to the conclusion. There plot moved along but without any actual development or the characters taking the plot along with them. There was no character development. Kendall has OCD and that's it. Jacian is a jackass...and that's it. I was looking forward to it and I was let down tremendously. Hated it.

  

--- 13. Infamous (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2010-11-27

I love Suzanne Brockmann and I hated this book. I read about halfway through and skimmed the rest. I hated the ghost. It was contrived and unnecessary and annoying. The main characters were likeable but they were completely lacking in romance and romantic chemistry which is kind of a must in romance books. All in all, I was very disappointed.

  

--- 14. Dark Flame (The Immortals, #4) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2010-11-27

I kind of hate the main characters in this book. The first book in this series held promise but I think I give up on the series now as they keep getting worse. The mythology is convoluted and Noel seems to be making it up as she goes along and to suit the main characters needs. The main characters are flat, boring and annoying.

  

--- 15. Going Bovine (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2010-06-14

This book was everywhere..on all the librarians blogs I read, everytime I went to the bookstore and it jumped out at me. I'm not sure how I feel about it...there were parts that I adored and parts that didn't work for me. I think I'll have to re-read it.

  

--- 16. If Angels Burn (Darkyn #1) (★☆☆☆☆) ---

Rated 1/5 on 2010-05-23

I didn't even finish this book. If it is being marketed as a romance then it is wrong because there is no romance in the book. And if it is being marketed as urban fantasy then the book simply sucks. The world-building is disjointed and clunky. The main characters are unlikable without one redeeming or enjoyable quality. Maybe the series will get better but based upon this book, I won't be checking out any further books in the series.

  

--- 17. Dawn of the Dreadfuls (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, #0.5) (★★★☆☆) ---

Rated 3/5 on 2010-05-11

Better than Pride and Prejudice and Zombies...

  

--- 18. The Knife of Never Letting Go (Chaos Walking, #1) (★★★★★) ---

Rated 5/5 on 2010-05-03

I loved, loved, loved this book. At first the constant use of dialect annoyed me but I got past it and realized that this book is simply made of the awesome. I loved the characters. The main character is kind of obstinate and annoying at times but still really likable. The story is fabulous. And I can't wait to get the sequel and read it.

  

--- 19. Beneath the Skin (The Maker's Song, #3) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2010-05-02

I love this series but this book was really just convoluted and disjointed.

  

--- 20. The Forest of Hands and Teeth (The Forest of Hands and Teeth, #1) (★★☆☆☆) ---

Rated 2/5 on 2010-04-29

Despite the fact that the story was basically The Village with zombies, I liked the world. I hated the characters, especially Mary, and was hoping that she would get bitten by the Unconsecrated. I did like the dog as he was the most likable character.
